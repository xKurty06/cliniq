              This policy covers CLINIQ, the clinic tracking and monitoring system used by Mendez
              Christian Academy&apos;s clinic. It applies to the information CLINIQ holds about

                <strong>Student information:</strong> name, Student Number, grade level, section,

                and medical conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Clinic records:</strong> visit records (date, complaint, treatment,
                outcome), incident/emergency records (including hospital referral and
                parent-notification details where applicable), and follow-up records.

              <li>
                <strong>Inventory records:</strong> medicine and supply stock levels and usage
                history. This does not identify students except where a specific dispensing is

            <ul className={listClass}>
              <li>
                To provide clinic care: logging visits and incidents, tracking treatment, and
                coordinating follow-up care.
              </li>
              <li>
                To respond to emergencies, including sharing relevant medical information (such as
                allergies) with the staff member treating a student.
              </li>
              <li>
                To maintain accountability for who accessed or changed a record, consistent with the
                Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173).
              </li>
              <li>
                To manage clinic operations: medicine and supply inventory, and reporting to school
                administration.

              <li>
                Active student, visit, and incident records are kept for as long as the student is
                enrolled.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a student leaves the school (graduates, transfers, or withdraws), their record
                is archived — hidden from active lists but not immediately deleted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Archived records are kept for up to 5 years after archiving, then deleted. This
                period exists in case a transferred student re-enrolls, and reflects the Data
                Privacy Act&apos;s principle of not keeping personal information longer than
                necessary.
              </li>
              <li>
                Audit log records are kept for a shorter period than clinic records, since their
                purpose is near-term accountability rather than long-term care history.

                Accounts are protected by individual logins; sessions last one week before requiring
                the user to sign in again.

              <li>Repeated failed login attempts lock the account for 30 minutes.</li>
              <li>
                Every access and change to a record is logged, with who performed it and when.
              </li>
              <li>
                The system runs on the school&apos;s local network; it is not exposed to the public
                internet.
