# mock-db: the frontend's single source of mock data

Every CLINIQ screen reads and writes data through this folder during the frontend-first phases
(ADR-006). Edit `mock-db.json` and every page changes with it. Decision record:
`CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/06-Decisions/ADR-014-Central-Mock-Data-Layer.md`.

> **Synthetic data only.** This repository is public, and these are minors' health records under
> RA 10173. Every name, Student Number, phone number, allergy, and condition in `mock-db.json` is
> invented. Never paste a real Mendez Christian Academy student or staff member into it. The
> integrity test checks that the notice in `meta` is still there and that dev passwords are
> obviously fake.

## How it fits together

```
mock-db.json        raw records only (hand-edited, never written at runtime)
  └─ seed.ts        the ONLY importer of the JSON; resolves relative dates + Student Number refs
     └─ store.ts    in-memory copy + every write since; injectable "today"; reset; persistence
        ├─ selectors.ts / dashboard.ts   every derived value (counts, flags, due states…)
        └─ api.ts   async reads/writes, audit logging, latency + preview switches
           └─ index.ts   public surface → features/*/api/*.ts → pages
```

Pages never import this folder's internals, and nothing outside `seed.ts` imports the JSON.
Feature `api/` modules import from `lib/mock-db` (the index). When the Laravel API lands, `api.ts`
is the file that becomes HTTP calls. Nothing above it has to change.

## Editing `mock-db.json` safely

1. **Store raw facts, never results.** No counts, totals, `recordComplete`, `isLowStock`,
   `dueState`, `flags`, report `data`… Selectors compute all of those. To make an item low-stock,
   lower its `currentStock`. To make a record incomplete, blank its `contactInfo` or set
   `emergencyContact` to `null`. The integrity test names the field if you store a derived value.
2. **Dates are relative.** Use `{ "daysAgo": 3 }` or `{ "daysFromNow": 11 }`. Timestamps add
   `"time": "HH:MM"` (Philippine time). Absolute dates are rejected because they go stale.
3. **Reference by key.** Visits, incidents, follow-ups, and reviews point at a student by
   `studentNumber` (`YYYY-NNNNN`, ADR-005). Follow-ups point at an existing visit or incident *of
   the same student*. Users are referenced by `id`. Complaints must come from
   `frontendOnly.visitComplaintTypes` / `incidentComplaintTypes`.
4. **Keep ids readable and unique:** `student-0053`, `visit-0160`, `item-0015`, `user-staff-02`.
5. **Shapes follow Frontend Context Brief §5** (`src/types/entities.ts`). This isn't a database
   design; the ERD is TBA. Anything a screen needs that §5 doesn't define lives under
   `frontendOnly` and is labelled mock-only. Don't add new top-level entities.
6. **Thresholds live in `config`.** They're open product decisions, not requirements (ADR-014).
7. Run the checks:

   ```bash
   npm test -- mock-db        # integrity + selectors + cross-screen sync
   npm run typecheck          # shape check of the JSON against the §5 types
   ```

   The app also refuses to start with a clear error listing every problem if the JSON fails the
   integrity check, so a bad edit can't quietly render wrong screens.

The seed must keep demonstrating every state on any day it's opened: overdue, due-today, and
upcoming follow-ups; expired, expiring-soon, and low-stock items; a Stage-1 incident; an
incomplete record; frequent visitors; visits today. `integrity.test.ts` checks this against
several far-apart "todays".

## Preview switches (dev only)

Add to any URL (see `devToggles.ts`):

| Query | Effect |
|---|---|
| `?mock=slow` | every call waits 2.5 s, so skeletons stay on screen |
| `?mock=error` | every call fails (error states) |
| `?mock=empty` | every read returns empty collections (empty states) |
| `?mockEmpty=visits,incidents` | empty only those collections, e.g. a profile with no history |
| `?mockLatency=1200` | explicit latency in ms (default 450) |
| `?mockPersist=on` / `off` | keep writes across reloads in localStorage (off clears them) |
| `?mockReset=1` | throw away every write and reload from the JSON |

In the browser console (dev builds): `cliniqMockDb.reset()`, `cliniqMockDb.setToday('2026-12-01')`,
`cliniqMockDb.setPersistence(true)`, `cliniqMockDb.snapshot()`.

## Dev accounts

One account per role, plus `demo.pe2`, which has `mustChangePassword: true` for the Force Password
Change screen (#2). Passwords are in `frontendOnly.devAccounts` and are deliberately fake
(`demo-…` / `dev-only-…`). The mock session (`session.ts`, `?role=staff|admin|instructor`) signs in as the
first account of each role that doesn't need a password change.

| Role | Username | Password | Password change required |
|---|---|---|---|
| School Clinician | `demo.nurse` | `demo-nurse` | No |
| Admin / Principal | `demo.principal` | `demo-admin` | No |
| PE/Sports Instructor | `demo.pe` | `demo-pe` | No |
| PE/Sports Instructor (password-change scenario) | `demo.pe2` | `demo-change` | Yes |

These are synthetic development fixtures only, not production credentials. The current mock session
still supports selecting a role from the URL, and the Login screen displays these accounts for local
demo purposes. Force Password Change is exercised by signing in as `demo.pe2`.

## Writing a new screen

- Add a request function to the feature's `api/` module that calls `lib/mock-db`. Load it with
  `useAsyncData` (ADR-013) and give the page a skeleton, an empty state, and an error state.
- Mutations go through a layer function, which writes the audit entry
  (`.claude/skills/cliniq-audit-trail/`). Don't call anything audit-related from a component.
- No inline arrays of records, counts, names, or dates in a component. If a value can be derived,
  add a selector.
