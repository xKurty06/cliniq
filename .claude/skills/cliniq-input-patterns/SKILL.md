# CLINIQ Input Patterns

Use this with `cliniq-interactive-states` whenever a text input is created or changed.

## One standard control treatment

- Reuse `frontend/src/components/ui/Input.tsx`; do not create page-local text input styling.
- Standard inputs are 40px tall, with `border-border`, a light card shadow, semibold 14px values, and a `brand-green` focus ring. This deliberately matches the shared `Select` trigger beside it.
- Keep the real visible label above the field, required indicator, nearby hint/error text, hover response, and visible keyboard focus treatment.
- Use an explicit local override only where a documented compact control is necessary; do not shrink filter inputs merely to create a different height from their paired dropdown.

## Leading icons and password reveal

- `Input` takes an optional `icon` (an `IconName`), drawn inside the field on the left in `text-secondary`. It is decorative (`aria-hidden`) and never replaces the visible label. Use it where an icon helps a user recognize the field, as on Login (`user` for Username, `lock` for Password); don't add one to every field by default.
- Every `type="password"` field automatically gets a reveal toggle on its right: a 32px eye/eye-off button named "Show password", with `aria-pressed` for its state. It's `type="button"`, so it never submits the form. Edge's built-in reveal eye is hidden so a field never shows two. Don't build a page-local reveal.
- Fields without `icon` or `type="password"` render exactly as before, with no extra wrapper.

## Date, month, and time fields

- Never use a native `type="date"`, `type="month"`, or `type="datetime-local"` input: their calendars are operating-system chrome. Use `DatePicker` (value `YYYY-MM-DD`) or `MonthPicker` (value `YYYY-MM`) from `frontend/src/components/ui/DatePicker.tsx`.
- The trigger is the shared 40px dropdown trigger with a `brand-green-dark` calendar icon, showing the value in the standard `Oct 2, 2026` / `October 2026` format and a muted placeholder when empty.
- The calendar is a floating, viewport-pinned panel: selected day/month in `brand-green-dark` with white text, today ringed in `brand-green`, a heading that zooms out to month and year grids, and a Today/This month footer action. Pass `min`/`max` instead of validating out-of-range picks afterward.
- `Clear` appears only for optional fields; pass `clearable={false}` for a value that must always exist without a required asterisk (for example a report period).
- A date-and-time value is a `DatePicker` plus a typed `Input type="time"`; the global stylesheet hides the browser's clock popup.
- Tests pick dates through `pickDate` / `pickMonth` in `frontend/src/test/pickDate.ts`.

## Scope

This rule covers text, search, number, date, month, time, and password fields. It does not replace `Select`, `DateRangePicker`, or `MultiSelect`; use the relevant shared control for those choices (the date-range custom From/To fields are themselves `DatePicker`s).
