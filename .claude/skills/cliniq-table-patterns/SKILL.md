description: Apply when building or changing a CLINIQ data table, especially one whose rows change with search, filters, sorting, pagination, date ranges, or report periods. Keeps columns stable, wide time-series tables readable, and table names accessible without repeating visible card headings.

# CLINIQ Table Patterns

Use this alongside `cliniq-interactive-states`, `cliniq-pagination-patterns`,
`cliniq-sorting-patterns`, and `cliniq-display-privacy` when a table is added or changed.

## Shared table boundary

- Reuse `frontend/src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx`; do not create a page-local table wrapper for the same behavior.
- Set `fixedLayout` whenever the table's row contents can change because of a search, filter, sort, pagination, date range, report period, tab, or other selection. This prevents browser auto-layout from moving columns when text lengths or badges differ between results.
- Use `DataTableColumn.width` for columns whose proportions matter. Widths should describe the table's intended hierarchy and add up to 100% when all columns are specified. Keep the table's existing horizontal scroller for narrow viewports.
- Keep the table semantic: use `rowHeader` for the identifying row cell, and keep column headers concise and accurate.

## Captions and visible headings

- Always provide a meaningful `caption`, even when the card header already names the table. The shared `DataTable` hides captions visually by default while keeping them available as the table's accessible name.
- Do not use an empty caption and do not duplicate a visible card heading inside the table. If the table must be visibly titled outside a card, opt out of `hideCaption` deliberately and preserve the caption text.

## Horizontal scrolling and sticky columns

- Keep horizontal scrolling on the shared `DataTable` wrapper; do not make the page itself scroll sideways.
- Set `stickyFirstColumn` when the first column identifies each row and `stickyLastColumn` when a summary/action column must remain available at the right edge. The shared component keeps either edge column opaque, layered above scrolled cells, and visually separated at its inner edge.
- Combine sticky columns with `fixedLayout` and calibrated widths. A sticky position without an intrinsic table width can still leave the browser compressing the columns until their content overlaps.
- When a fixed-layout table must grow past its scroller (a wide time series), give it an explicit `minTableWidth` equal to the sum of its column widths (e.g. `calc(26ch + 12 * 8rem + 5rem)`). Don't use `min-w-max` / `min-width: max-content` on a fixed-layout table: how browsers resolve max-content for `table-layout: fixed` isn't consistently defined. Don't drop `fixedLayout` to get overflow either: the column widths only apply with it, so columns would reshuffle as rows are filtered.
- Verify the actual scroll interaction at the left edge, middle, and far-right positions. Each sticky edge column must remain inside the scroller viewport, readable, and not show the columns underneath through its background.

## Wide time-series tables

- Cap period columns in the table view itself when a date range can produce a wide time series; do not cap the shared aggregation or chart data just to make a table fit.
- Show the most recent periods, preserve the source bucket indexes for counts and cluster markers, and add a plain note below the table stating how many earlier periods are hidden and how to see them.
- Keep period headers compact when their repeated prefix adds no information in a dense table (for example, use `Sep 14` in a weekly table while retaining `Week of Sep 14` in chart explanations and tooltips). Drop the year from period headers too: show it once in the card title (e.g. `Visits trend · 2025–2026`), keep it in each header's accessible name as screen-reader-only text, and size period columns to the short header (the Dashboard trend table uses 5rem). Yearly periods keep their year, since it is the period.
- Keep the cap local to the table's view model so charts, summary totals, and other dashboard panels continue to represent the full selected range.

## Low-signal rows

- For a dense period table, hide rows whose count is zero across every visible period by default. Decide this from the post-cap visible bucket window, not from the full source range.
- Provide a small, clearly labelled toggle with `aria-pressed` that reveals all complaint types, including rows hidden by the zero-activity rule.
- Filter only the table rows. Never mutate the source series or the totals used by another panel; the Common complaints card and its selected-range totals must remain unchanged.

## Verification

- In the screen test, assert that changing the relevant filter still leaves the same table structure and that a fixed table has the `table-fixed` class.
- For calibrated tables, assert the `col` widths so a later content change cannot silently restore auto-layout.
- For sticky wide tables, assert the sticky edge-column classes and verify both identifying and summary cells remain readable at multiple real horizontal scroll positions.
- For wide time-series tables, assert no more than 12 period columns, the earlier-period note, and that the chart still receives the uncapped bucket list.
- For low-signal filtering, assert a zero-activity row is hidden by default, appears after the labelled toggle is pressed, and does not alter another panel's totals.
- Apply the display-privacy rule to the row content and the pagination pattern when the list can grow.
