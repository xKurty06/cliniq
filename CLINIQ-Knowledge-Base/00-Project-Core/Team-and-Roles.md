# Team, Roles, and Project Organization — Full Detail

Kept in sync with the canonical Project Plan, Section 2. If you edit one, edit both.

## 2. Project Organization

### 2.1 External Interfaces

| Party | Role in the Project |
|---|---|
| Ms. Jenne Baas, School Head Nurse | Primary client contact and product owner; validates requirements, participates in UAT, receives training |
| Mendez Christian Academy Administration / Principal | Sponsor of the digitalization effort; consumer of health summary reports |
| Registrar's Office | Source of authoritative student information used to populate Student Records |
| PE/Sports Department | Source of injury referrals, logged by Staff; instructors also have direct read-only QR access to a student's profile and injury history (Section 5.3) |
| School's Outsourced IT Provider | Maintains the existing workstation and network; partner for quarterly backup-recovery testing and major hardware issues |
| CvSU–CEIT Course Adviser / Panel | Academic oversight, milestone review, and grading |

### 2.2 Internal Structure

The development team is intentionally small — a structure that mirrors the client's own "insufficient manpower" reality and forces the same discipline the system is meant to bring to the clinic: clear roles, no duplicated effort, and standardized handoffs. All three members report jointly to the client (for requirements and acceptance) and to the course adviser (for academic milestones); there is no separate management layer between developers and the client.

### 2.3 Roles and Responsibilities

| Member | Primary Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| Ghenly B. Tinapay — Project Manager | Overall coordination and scheduling; client liaison; consolidates documentation and deliverables; manages scope and risk register; leads status reporting to the adviser |
| Christian John C. Lugami — System Analyst | Requirements validation with the client; ERD/DFD and UI design; maps SWOT findings to functional requirements; coordinates UAT scenarios and test cases |
| Zean Kurt G. Balboa — Developer / Tester | Front-end and back-end implementation; database schema and queries; unit and integration testing; deployment on the client workstation; leads staff training sessions |

Because the team has only three members, all three are expected to contribute across boundaries where needed (e.g., all participate in client interviews and in UAT); the table above reflects primary, not exclusive, ownership.
