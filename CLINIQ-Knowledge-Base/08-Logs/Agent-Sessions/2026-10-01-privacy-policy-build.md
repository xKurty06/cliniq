# Agent Session — Screen #36 Privacy Policy

Date/Day/Time: Thursday, October 01, 2026 — 10:09 PHT
Agent: Codex
Task: Build Screen #36 Privacy Policy and its sidebar footer entry point.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Build the Privacy Policy destination page from the existing reference content, make it reachable from a sidebar footer link for Staff, Admin/Principal, and PE/Sports Instructor, do not add the separately designed footer items, render the policy as-is, verify the screen, and update the project records.

Changes Made:
- Added a static semantic Privacy Policy page under the legal feature area, transcribing the reference headings, paragraphs, lists, emphasis, table, disclaimer, and unresolved Contact placeholder without changing the policy text.
- Used the narrow long-form content width and readable typography from the Design System. The page has no data fetching, loading skeleton, audit logging, or student data.
- Added `/privacy-policy` with explicit access for all three roles. The route opts the instructor into the normal shell only for this shared legal page; other instructor route behavior is unchanged.
- Added the Privacy Policy text link in a bottom-pinned sidebar footer block below the nav groups, visible to all three roles.
- Extended `cliniq-sidebar-patterns` from brand-only guidance to include the reusable footer-link pattern: separated footer block, 40px target, active/hover/focus states, and collapsed accessibility label/title. Updated Skills Setup accordingly. Old skill scope: brand rules only; new scope: brand rules plus shared footer-link rules.
- Did not add version, Report an Issue, or HealWare credit placeholders.
Reason:
The source documents and checklist item were present, so the implementation follows the existing modular feature convention with a dedicated `features/legal` module rather than placing legal content in a business-domain feature.
Testing Performed:
- Focused Vitest tests: 3 files passed, 20 tests passed.
- Full Vitest suite: 46 files passed, 205 tests passed.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite production build completed successfully.
- Live Playwright browser check: the Staff Dashboard showed the Privacy Policy footer link, and the `/privacy-policy` page was verified after its lazy content settled; the page heading, policy table, exact TBD content, and absence of the sample student name were confirmed.
- The configured Playwright MCP server was not exposed in this session. The Admin/Principal and PE/Sports Instructor route/link behavior is covered by the parameterized route tests, which also confirmed no audit entries are recorded for the page.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
Known Issues:
- The policy is intentionally still marked Draft, and the Contact section remains the exact unresolved TBD placeholder from the source. No content correction was made.
- The configured Playwright MCP endpoint was unavailable, so only Staff received the live browser pass; the other two roles have automated route coverage.
Next Steps:
Future sidebar footer items (version number, Report an Issue, and HealWare credit) require their own approved design and separate implementation.
