Changes Made:
- Added a 280ms ease-out chart entrance plus 160ms point, hover, and tooltip transitions.

- Added regression coverage for the chart interaction configuration.
Reason:
- The request asked for smoother, more responsive Visits Trend chart interaction while keeping the Chart.js implementation lightweight for the clinic workstation.
