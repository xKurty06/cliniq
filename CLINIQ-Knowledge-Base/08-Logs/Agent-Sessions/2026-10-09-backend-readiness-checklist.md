Agent: Codex
Task: Integrate and fact-check the backend readiness checklist.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "I've added a new file, `Backend-Readiness-Checklist.md`, at CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base\04-Development\CLINIQ_Backend_Readiness_Checklist.md. Integrate it into the knowledge base. Do not rewrite its contents beyond what is listed below."
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Backend-Readiness-Checklist.md` (renamed from `CLINIQ_Backend_Readiness_Checklist.md`)
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Development-Phases.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/02-Architecture/Database/ERD.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-09-backend-readiness-checklist.md`
Changes Made:
- Fetched and reviewed all current local and origin branches plus their history; current `main` is `4c3c8c9`.
- Renamed the supplied checklist, added its required verification timestamp, and fact-checked the listed repository claims.
- Corrected the feature API-file count (18 → 21), clarified the ERD status, Sanctum-mode status, module-count inconsistency, and which report-storage recommendation is absent from `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
- Added the requested one-line pointers under Phase B1 and in ERD.md. No 04-Development index/README exists to update.
Reason: Keep the new backend-planning artifact current and discoverable without treating its recommendations as approved ADR decisions.
Testing Performed:
- Read-only repository audit: `git fetch origin --prune`, all-branch listing and history review, backend tree inspection, targeted document comparison, mock API export count, and feature API-file count.
- Confirmed `backend/` remains skeleton-only (README and `.env.example`), Laravel is unscaffolded, ERD.md remains TBA, and no backend/frontend code was edited.
Known Issues:
- Module counts remain internally inconsistent across the backend README (9 feature modules), NFR (10), and Module Overview (10 in its introduction; 11 numbered modules). The checklist records this pre-existing drift; it was not resolved in this documentation-integration task.
- The report-storage recommendation is not currently an open item in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
Next Steps:
- Resolve the ERD/data dictionary and the documented recommendations with project approval before Phase B1 migrations.
