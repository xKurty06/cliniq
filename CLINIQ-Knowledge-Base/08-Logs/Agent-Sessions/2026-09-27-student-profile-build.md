Task: Build Phase F1 Student Profile screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue the frontend takeover using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` Phase 1 sequencing after the Dashboard retroactive audit; the next required F1 screen is Student Profile.

Changes Made:
- Added a mock-backed Student Profile API adapter over the shared dataset.
- Built `StudentProfilePage` with full-name single-student lookup, Overview, Medical History, Visit History, Incident History, incident stage badges, Staff-only Edit/Print/Archive actions, Instructor read-only messaging, empty states, and shaped skeleton loading.
- Added a temporary `?screen=student-profile` preview path in `App.tsx` without choosing a routing library.
- Added mock Instructor session support for role-conditional frontend previewing.
- Added an archive icon to the existing inline icon set.
- Added tests for full-name display, Staff actions, Instructor read-only behavior, and loading skeletons.
- Checked the Student Profile Build box and filled its Build Resume Note. Audit remains unchecked per Phase 1 rules.
Reason:
- Student Profile is F1 reference screen #1 in the current build sequence and establishes the single-record/detail pattern later detail screens will reuse.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 6 files / 31 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- Student Profile has not received its Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate pass yet; this is expected until all Phase 1 screens are built.
- The `?screen=student-profile` preview switch is temporary until the routing-library decision is made.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 1 with New Visit Entry (`features/clinic-visits/`), including the Follow-Up prompt and Smart Triage panel.
