Agent: Codex
Task: Add a repository-local skill for CLINIQ dropdown selection and sizing patterns.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Also if there's no local skill available for specific fix for global like a drop down, generate the skills for local so the next prompt will see that skill and apply the same concepts"
Files Modified: `.claude/skills/cliniq-dropdown-patterns/SKILL.md`, `04-Development/Skills-Setup.md`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Added the `cliniq-dropdown-patterns` skill, documenting the icon-free selected state, content-fit custom menu width, narrow-screen bound, and required keyboard/listbox semantics. Registered it in Skills Setup so future agents discover it during the required skill read-through.
Reason: Preserve the requested dropdown conventions as a reusable repository-local rule rather than relying on remembered context.
Testing Performed: Manual frontmatter and instruction-scope review completed. The skill-creator `quick_validate.py` tool could not run because its `yaml` Python dependency is absent from the environment.
Known Issues: Automated skill validation is unavailable until the environment provides PyYAML; no application code is affected.
Next Steps: Apply `cliniq-dropdown-patterns` alongside `cliniq-interactive-states` whenever a custom dropdown is added or changed.
