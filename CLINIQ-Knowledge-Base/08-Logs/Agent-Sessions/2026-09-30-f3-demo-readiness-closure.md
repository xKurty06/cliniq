Changes Made: Audited the checklist and found one unchecked item: the F3 exit check. Its close conditions also exposed 18 checked F0/F1 rows with blank audit resume notes and an obsolete F3 note referring to blockers resolved in later sessions. Reconciled every blank audit note to the existing current verification evidence, then checked and documented F3. During final validation, lint identified a synchronous state update in the Audit Log pagination reset. Replaced the effect with atomic filter updates that reset the page in the originating interaction, and added a regression test.
Reason: The checklist must reflect the current live frontend and only be marked demo-ready after the recorded blockers, resume notes, and deterministic verification have been reconciled.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run lint` passed with no errors (two existing Fast Refresh warnings); `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd test` passed (39 files, 151 tests); `npm.cmd run build` passed. The focused Audit Log regression test passed (6 tests).
Known Issues: No frontend-demo implementation blocker remains. Laravel/Sanctum authorization, database schema, live API persistence, and the separately documented product decisions remain future work outside this frontend-first F3 gate. Browser-driver limitations still prevent a live axe run; source-level accessibility checks and the deterministic test suite pass.
Next Steps: Demonstrate the mock-backed frontend to the client. Preserve the current screen contracts and enforce authorization, persistence, and any accepted product decisions during the backend phases.
