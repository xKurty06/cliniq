Task: Build Phase F2 #12 Visit Detail/Edit
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue taking over the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, following Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md screen by screen.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitDetailPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitDetailPage.test.tsx`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-visit-detail-edit-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added the Staff-only Visit Detail/Edit screen with full student name and clinical details visible for a deliberately opened single record.
- Added a read-mode context card, edit-mode complaint/treatment/disposition/event-tag controls, inline validation, and success feedback.
- Added mock `update` audit logging when Staff saves edited visit details.
- Added shaped skeleton loading, error/forbidden states, preview routing through `?screen=visit-detail`, and focused tests.
- Marked Phase F2 #12 Visit Detail/Edit Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- Phase F2 Clinic Visit Monitoring screens are being built in checklist order before the later cross-screen audit pass.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 23 test files / 73 tests.
Known Issues:
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with #13 Excuse Letter Generator (+ print layout).
