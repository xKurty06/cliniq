Task: Begin frontend loop takeover, run Phase 0, and retroactively audit the built Clinic Overview Dashboard
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: The user asked me to stop taking one-off screen instructions and take over the frontend using `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`: confirm the repo is current with GitHub, run Phase 0 once, audit/fix the already-built Dashboard against Reference 1, Screen #31, Module 9, Design-System rules, and the three CLINIQ skills, inventory shared components/patterns, check Dashboard Build/Audit boxes with notes, then continue the remaining screen sequence.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/DashboardHeader.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-dashboard-loop-takeover-audit.md`
Changes Made:
- Confirmed local branch `feature/clinic-overview-dashboard` matches `origin/feature/clinic-overview-dashboard` at `f4cb0cc`.
- Ran Phase 0 once: read the changelog, decisions, issues, skills setup, CLINIQ bespoke skills, and relevant project/design/requirements sources.
- Audited the Dashboard against Reference 1, Screen Inventory #31, Module 9, Design-System skeleton/interaction rules, display privacy, audit trail, and interactive states.
- Fixed the Staff Dashboard header so `Clinic Overview` remains the required page title, moving the Staff greeting into supporting copy.
- Updated Dashboard tests for the corrected header behavior.
- Checked the Dashboard Build and Audit boxes and filled both resume notes, explicitly recording that the Dashboard was built first/out of original F1 order.
- Corrected the stale `Issues-and-TODOs.md` known gap saying no code exists yet.
- Inventoried the current shared frontend patterns: `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, `StatusBadge`, `Input`, `DateRangePicker`, `SegmentedControl`, `Skeleton`, `StatCard`, `ListCard`, `ListRow`, `DataTable`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorState`, `AppShell`, `Sidebar`, status maps, chart setup, mock dataset/session helpers, and `useAsyncData`.
Reason:
- The first Dashboard build predated the explicit interactive-states skill and needed a real retroactive audit before later screens reused its patterns.
- Reference 1 requires a header/page title, and the code comment claimed the Dashboard always said `Clinic Overview`, but the Staff H1 had become only a greeting.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 4 files / 27 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- Remaining F1/F2 screens are not built yet.
- Phase 2 for the full frontend must not begin until all Phase 1 Build boxes are complete, except this Dashboard retroactive audit requested by the user.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 1 build order from `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`: build F1 Student Profile next, reusing the Dashboard-established shared components and patterns.
