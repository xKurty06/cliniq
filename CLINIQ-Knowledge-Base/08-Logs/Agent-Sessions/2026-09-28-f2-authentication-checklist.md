Task: Add missing Phase F2 authentication and Incident Log List checklist items; document sample mock accounts
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "In CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md, add three missing checklist items... Then log the change per AGENTS.md with a real timestamp from your system clock, plus a Changelog entry." Follow-up: "Redo, read the prompt again, then also input in an md file the sample accounts including for the school clinician"
Files Modified: `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`; `cliniq-frontend/src/lib/mock-db/README.md`; `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`; this session log
Changes Made: Confirmed ADR-010 exists. Confirmed that no Login route/page or Force Password Change screen exists in `cliniq-frontend/src`, so both new Authentication (Module 1) checklist rows remain unchecked. Added the requested Incident Log List row. Added an explicitly development-only table of synthetic mock accounts, including the School Clinician account, to the mock-data README.
Reason: Keep the Phase F2 inventory aligned with the accepted one-week session decision and make the existing mock fixtures discoverable without implying that authentication UI exists.
Testing Performed: Searched `cliniq-frontend/src` for Login and Force Password Change routes/pages; verified ADR-010; inspected the mock-data source and README; checked the live GitHub HEAD before editing.
Known Issues: The live GitHub HEAD was reachable, but the local documentation working tree contains pre-existing unrelated changes that were left untouched. Login and Force Password Change are documented but not implemented.
Next Steps: Build the Module 1 authentication screens in their scheduled phase, with server-side Sanctum enforcement and the ADR-010 token-expiry behavior.
