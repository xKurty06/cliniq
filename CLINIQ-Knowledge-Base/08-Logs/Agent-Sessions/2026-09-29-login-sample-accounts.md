# Agent Session

Agent: Codex
Task: Display the synthetic sample accounts on the Login screen for demo purposes.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Also display the sampleaccounts there for demo pur0oses”
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/lib/mock-db/README.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- this session log
Changes Made: Added a responsive, labelled “Sample accounts for this demo” panel showing all four synthetic usernames, passwords, roles, and scenario notes. Added an explicit warning that the credentials are not real clinic or production accounts. Corrected the mock-data README wording to reflect that the auth screens now exist.
Reason: Make the frontend-first Login flow immediately usable during client demonstrations without implying that the displayed credentials are production authentication data.
Testing Performed: Tuesday, September 29, 2026 — 09:42: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd test -- --run` passed with 37 test files / 142 tests; `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: The sample credentials are intentionally visible on the mock Login screen and must be removed when the real Sanctum login flow replaces the frontend mock.
Next Steps: Include the demo-only disclosure in the Phase F2 Login accessibility audit; remove the visible sample credentials when the real Sanctum flow replaces the mock.
