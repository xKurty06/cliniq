Task: Apply the Visits Trend chart interaction treatment to every other frontend chart.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Now update other charts too if there is"

Changes Made:
- Audited frontend Chart.js usage and found one other chart: Reports Health Summary's horizontal bar chart.
- Extracted shared white, transform/opacity-animated HTML tooltip behavior and the reduced-motion preference hook.
- Applied the shared tooltip plus brief Chart.js entrance and hover transitions to Health Summary; its bar-specific layout and data behavior are unchanged.
- Moved Visits Trend to the shared helpers and added Dashboard/Reports regression coverage.
Reason:
- The requester asked for the chart updates to be applied to every other chart if present.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx src/features/reports/ReportsPage.test.tsx` (19 passed).
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues:
- No other frontend Chart.js charts exist; the line-chart edge/grid treatment remains specific to Visits Trend and does not apply to horizontal bars.
Next Steps:
- None.
