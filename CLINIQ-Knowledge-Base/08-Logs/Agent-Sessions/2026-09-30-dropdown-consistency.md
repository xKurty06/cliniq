Changes Made:
- What was inconsistent (verified in a live Chromium session before changing anything):
  - The reference (Dashboard date range) is a 40px semibold trigger with a 14px chevron and a themed listbox. The same picker on Visit Log, Incident Log, and Audit Log used a smaller 32px variant.
  - The shared `Select` was a restyled native `<select>`: regular weight, a 16px chevron, and an open menu drawn by the operating system.
  - Four screens did not use the shared `Select` at all. New Visit, Report Incident, Student List, and Add/Edit Student each carried their own native `<select>` wrapper.
  - `MultiSelect` had its own trigger and panel classes (regular weight, 16px chevron, wider panel padding).
  - On Audit Log the four filters in one row had two heights and the date range did not fill its cell.
- One source for the look: `dropdownClassName.ts` holds the reference's trigger, chevron, panel, and option-row classes. `DateRangePicker`, `Select`, and `MultiSelect` all use it. The Dashboard control itself renders the same as before.
- `Select` is now a themed trigger with an accessible listbox (`aria-haspopup="listbox"`, `role="listbox"` / `role="option"`), with no new dependency. Its props are unchanged apart from dropping the pass-through of native `<select>` attributes; `required` and `disabled` are explicit props. Behavior:
  - Keyboard: Arrow keys open it and move between options, Home/End, typing jumps to a matching option (a typed space is part of the label, it does not select), Enter or Space selects, Escape closes, Tab closes and continues to the next field. Focus returns to the trigger on close.
  - The trigger is as wide as its longest option, like a native select, so it does not resize when the selection changes (Follow-Ups Status stays 125px).
  - The panel is pinned to the trigger in viewport coordinates. An absolutely positioned panel would be clipped by `DataTable`'s horizontal scroll container (Follow-Ups has a status dropdown on every pending row). It opens upward when there is more room above, and scrolls past 256px.
  - `onChange` fires only when the value changes, as the native control did.
- `DateRangePicker` has one trigger size (40px) on every screen, and a new `fullWidth` prop, used on Audit Log so the date range fills its filter cell like the three controls beside it.
- `MultiSelect` takes the shared trigger, chevron, and panel. Its rows keep their checkboxes (`cliniq-multi-select-patterns`).
- The four page-local native selects were removed in favor of the shared `Select`. Add/Edit Student uses `size="sm"` so it still lines up with the 32px inputs beside it.
- Skill edited, `cliniq-dropdown-patterns` (old → new):
  - Old: "Use a custom accessible listbox only when this visual behavior is required; otherwise retain the native control's existing accessibility and styling." New: no native `<select>` and no page-local wrapper; single-choice dropdowns use the shared `Select`.
  - New section naming the Dashboard date range as the reference, `dropdownClassName.ts` as the one place the look lives, the two trigger sizes, and the rule that a leading icon belongs only to a dropdown whose type calls for one.
  - Old: `DateRangePicker` named as the shared pattern. New: `Select`, `DateRangePicker`, and `MultiSelect` named by purpose, plus the viewport-pinned panel and the `selectOption` test helper.
  - `Design-System.md` ("Buttons, Controls & Shape Language") gained a "Current standard" sentence saying the same, so the two do not drift. Its existing minimum (no native OS chrome) still holds.
Reason: The owner asked for every dropdown to match the Dashboard's date-range control. A native `<select>` cannot match it, because its open menu is operating-system chrome; sharing one set of classes keeps the three dropdown components from drifting apart again.
Testing Performed: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 23:22:
- `npm run typecheck` passed. `npx eslint src`: 0 errors (1 existing `react-refresh` warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`). `npm run build` passed.
- `npm test`: 41 files / 192 tests passed. 6 of them are new `Select` tests (trigger, selected-row treatment, click selection, full keyboard path, outside click and disabled, required/error naming). 16 existing tests that drove a native `<select>` were updated to open the listbox and choose an option.
- Live, Chromium via Playwright, Staff account, 1440×900: opened all 17 routes that could hold a dropdown. No native `<select>` remains. Every standard trigger measures 40px, weight 600, padding 12px/32px; the two `sm` uses (Add/Edit Student grade level, Follow-Ups row status) measure 32px. The Dashboard reference matches its before screenshot.
- Live interaction: QR Print (48 options) scrolls inside a 256px panel and typing "2026" jumps to a matching student; Add Student: Tab in, Enter, typing "grade 11" lands on Grade 11 without the space selecting, Enter selects, Tab moves to the next field; Follow-Ups: the last row's panel opens upward and is not clipped, Missed opens the confirmation, and Keep Pending returns focus to the row's trigger.
- 390px: the row panel is not clipped by the scrolling table; the Dispense panel stays inside the viewport.
Known Issues:
- Dropdown value text is semibold (the reference's weight) while text in an `Input` beside it is regular, and dropdowns use `border-border` with a soft shadow while `Input` uses the darker `border-text-secondary`. This is the reference's look applied as asked; it is listed in `Issues-and-TODOs.md` for the owner to confirm.
- In list filter rows the search `Input` is 32px and the dropdown beside it 40px (now the same on Student List, Inventory, Visit Log, and Incident Log). `Input` was out of scope.
- A placeholder ("Update status", "Select complaint") is still the first row of the list, as it was in the native control.
- On a 390px screen a very long option label (Dispense item) is cut at the panel's right edge.
- Found, unrelated to dropdowns: at 390px with a visible vertical scrollbar (375px usable), the top bar's account area overflows the page by 7px.
- The canonical `CLINIQ_Frontend_Context_Brief.md` and `CLINIQ_Frontend_Design_Reference.md` still describe only the minimum (custom-styled, never native chrome). That remains true; they were not edited. No ADR was written: this is a design-system refinement, not a requirement or scope decision.
Next Steps:
- Owner: confirm or reverse the three look choices listed in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
- If the owner wants inputs and dropdowns to share one height and border, change `Input` in one pass across all forms.
