Changes Made:
- Added Screen #15 as a Staff-only, lazy-loaded `/incidents` route with Staff navigation.
- Built the list against the established Visit Log pattern: date range, Student Number/reason/event search, completion filter, Student Number-only rows, Needs Completion/Complete badges, report links, and skeleton/error/empty states.
- Kept incident reasons visible in the list as ADR-010 requires while withholding student names.
- Corrected Screen #20 to resolve an incident's real linked `Student.studentNumber` from shared data rather than manufacturing one from `studentId`.
- Added focused route/list/report regression coverage.
Reason:
- Both items were blocking the F2 implementation gate and the archive bug could display an incorrect privacy-safe identifier.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- src/features/emergency-response/IncidentLogListPage.test.tsx src/features/reports/ReportsPage.test.tsx src/routes/AppRoutes.test.tsx` — passed: 3 files, 13 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed: 117 modules transformed.
Known Issues:
- Formal F2 Phase 2 audit boxes remain pending; F1 accessibility-tool evidence is also still missing.
Next Steps:
- Run and record the complete F2 Phase 2 countercheck/audit now that every F2 Build item is present.
