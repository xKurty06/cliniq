Agent: Codex
Task: Add Privacy Policy infrastructure and a HealWare credit to the repository.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Add Privacy Policy infrastructure and a HealWare credit to the repo. Credit HealWare in the README Team section, add Screen #36 Privacy Policy and update the screen count, fix the canonical count, add the Sidebar Footer / Legal checklist item, create the policy draft verbatim, and log the coherent documentation change. Do not touch frontend/ or backend/.”
Files Modified:
- README.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/03-Design/Screen-Inventory.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-privacy-policy-healware-credit.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/09-References/Canonical-Documents.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/09-References/Privacy-Policy.md
Changes Made:
- Added a HealWare team credit above the README team table, cross-referencing the existing sidebar branding skill.
- Added Screen #36, Sidebar Footer / Legal, and updated the Screen Inventory and canonical approximate count to ~37.
- Added the unchecked Build/Audit checklist item for the static Privacy Policy screen.
- Created the Privacy Policy draft exactly as supplied in the request, including its draft caveats and unresolved contact placeholder.
Reason: The request establishes the legal-information screen and draft policy as documentation infrastructure while preserving the existing logo/favicon decision and frontend-first checklist.
Testing Performed:
- Compared `Privacy-Policy.md` with the exact policy block in the pasted request.
- Confirmed no files under `frontend/` or `backend/` were modified.
- `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: The policy remains a draft and its Contact section is intentionally unresolved, exactly as requested.
Next Steps: Build and audit Screen #36 in a future frontend task; do not alter the policy text during that task.
