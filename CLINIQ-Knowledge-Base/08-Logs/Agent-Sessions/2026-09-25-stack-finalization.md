Task: Finalize all previously-pending tech stack items (libraries, bundler) with researched, current best choices
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "also update the stack about additional libraries, you choose which library is best and modern, then for the bundler, choose the same best and modern. resolve also the other but let me know everything you do"
Files Modified: 02-Architecture/Tech-Stack.md, 04-Development/Environment-Setup.md, 08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md, 08-Logs/Changelog.md, 06-Decisions/ADR-007-Stack-Finalization.md (new), plus the canonical CLINIQ_Project_Plan.md (Section 4.3, Revision 2.2)
Changes Made:
- Searched current (2026) maintenance status for each pending item rather than assuming prior knowledge was still accurate.
- Vite confirmed as build tool (current default for React SPAs).
- Laravel Sanctum confirmed for auth.
- XAMPP confirmed as the standardized local dev environment.
- Backend QR: endroid/qr-code chosen over simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode (latter unmaintained since 2021).
- Frontend QR: qr-scanner (nimiq) chosen over the more "modern-looking" @yudiel/react-qr-scanner, specifically because the latter depends entirely on the Barcode Detection API, which Safari/iOS has never supported — a real, current compatibility gap that would have silently broken scanning on iPhones. qr-scanner falls back to its own decoder and works universally.
- Chart.js (via react-chartjs-2) chosen over Recharts for smaller bundle size and Canvas rendering, given the 4GB RAM target.
Reason: Explicit request to resolve all pending stack items with "best and modern" choices, with full transparency on what was decided.
Testing Performed: N/A — research and documentation only, nothing installed or executed.
Known Issues: qr-scanner has no built-in React bindings and will need a small custom wrapper component — noted as an accepted, low-risk trade-off in ADR-007, not a blocker.
Next Steps: Environment setup (04-Development/Environment-Setup.md) is now fully specified and ready to execute once approved — nothing has actually been installed yet.
