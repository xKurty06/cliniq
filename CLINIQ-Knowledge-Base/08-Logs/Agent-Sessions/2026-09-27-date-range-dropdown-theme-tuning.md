Task: Tune the dashboard date range dropdown so it no longer looks like a generic/native control, then reduce the first pass after user feedback that it was overdone.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "The date range drop down ui looks generic not themed" followed by "you overdid" with a screenshot showing the first custom dropdown pass as too prominent.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/components/ui/DateRangePicker.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-date-range-dropdown-theme-tuning.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Replaced the visible native select chrome with a small custom preset trigger/listbox using existing CLINIQ icons, spacing, radius, border, hover, focus, and shadow tokens.
- Kept the final styling intentionally quiet after feedback: neutral border, compact menu, subtle selected state, no bright selected row, and no oversized icon tile.
- Preserved custom From/To range validation and inline error behavior.
- Updated dashboard tests to cover the themed trigger/listbox and custom-range selection path.
Reason:
- The CLINIQ design system and `cliniq-interactive-states` skill require dropdowns/selects to be styled instead of left as generic OS/browser chrome, but the control still needs to feel like a restrained dashboard filter rather than a primary action.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- DashboardPage.test.tsx`
- `npm.cmd run build`
Known Issues:
- None found.
Next Steps:
- Visually confirm the quieter dropdown against the running dashboard when reviewing the page.
