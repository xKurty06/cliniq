Changes Made:
- Removed the CardHeader sticky/top/z-index/background override from Visits Trend.
- Added a regression test that confirms the card header is not sticky.
- Preserved the time-series table's independent sticky first and last columns.
Reason:
- The request was to let Visits Trend scroll normally instead of pinning its header below the AppShell bar.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx` (10 passed).
Known Issues:
- None identified for this change.
Next Steps:
