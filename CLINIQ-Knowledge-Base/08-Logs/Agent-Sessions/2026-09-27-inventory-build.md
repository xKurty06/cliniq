Changes Made:
- Built Staff-only Inventory List with search, category filter, stock/expiration status, and accessible table fallback.
- Built Add/Edit Inventory Item with validation, loading skeleton, success/error feedback, and create/update audit events.
- Built Dispense/Log Usage with optional Student Number linkage, quantity validation, submit audit logging, and below-zero warning behavior required by Module 8.
- Added lazy-loaded routes and enabled Inventory in Staff navigation.
- Converted the QR mobile Dispense Medicine action from a dead button into a real link to `/inventory/dispense?student=...`.
Reason: Inventory was the next completely absent module, and its dispense destination was already exposed by the QR flow.
Testing Performed:
- Full frontend test suite: 29 files, 91 tests passed.
- TypeScript/Vite production build passed.
Known Issues: Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate/Confirm remains pending. Mock mutations are audit-logged but do not persist across a page reload until the backend phase.
Next Steps: Continue Phase 1 with the next missing module screens, then run the combined cross-screen audit after the Build phase is complete.
