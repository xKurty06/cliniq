Task: Resolve actionable entries in Issues-and-TODOs.md.
Status: Partial — all actionable frontend defects resolved; decision-dependent and backend-phase items remain open.

Changes Made:
- Added the role-aware mobile navigation dialog and compact mobile header treatment to AppShell.
- Replaced the desktop QR hub’s idle skeleton with an instructional empty state.
- Standardized shared inputs with selects; created cliniq-input-patterns to retain the rule.
- Made all DataTable horizontal scrollers keyboard-focusable; moved Student duplicate detection to the shared Modal.
- Put the Dashboard header on the shared Card surface, made Incident Archive newest-first, and shortened the Dispense stock label for narrow viewports.
- Added focused regression coverage for mobile navigation, desktop QR idle state, and archive order.
Reason: These were confirmed, reproducible implementation defects or presentation inconsistencies in the current issue log. Explicit school-policy, data-schema, and backend-phase decisions were preserved as open because they cannot safely be resolved through frontend code.
Testing Performed:
- npm.cmd test — 41 files, 195 tests passed.
- npm.cmd run typecheck — passed.
- npm.cmd run build — passed.
- npm.cmd run lint — no errors; one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning remains in components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx.
Known Issues:
- The remaining entries requiring a school/product decision (PE clinical default wording, Stage-1 sign-off policy, threshold settings), ERD design, and Phase B2 server-side authentication/authorization are intentionally open.
Next Steps:
- Obtain owner/nurse decisions for the explicitly marked product-policy items, then implement the matching backend phases after the ERD is finalized.
