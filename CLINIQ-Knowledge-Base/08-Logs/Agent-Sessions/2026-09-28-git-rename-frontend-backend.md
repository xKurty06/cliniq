Task: Rename the two top-level application folders with Git history preservation and update live path references.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Rename the top-level folders in this repo: cliniq-frontend/ -> frontend/ and cliniq-backend/ -> backend/, using git mv so history is preserved. Then update every reference to the old names... Then run the frontend build and the test suite to confirm nothing broke. Log the change per AGENTS.md with a real timestamp and add a Changelog entry."
Files Modified: Git-tracked application paths, .gitignore, README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, live knowledge-base Markdown references, frontend package metadata, this session log, and Changelog.md.
Changes Made: Used git mv to rename the complete tracked frontend and backend directories. Updated live path references while preserving historical Changelog and Agent-Sessions entries. Updated frontend package metadata to match the new project folder name.
Reason: Direct user request to simplify the repository's top-level application folder names without losing Git history.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run build` passed. The full `npm.cmd test` run had 134/135 tests pass; `src/routes/AppRoutes.test.tsx` failed once when run with the full suite, then passed all 8 tests in an isolated rerun. `git diff --check` passed, and a whole-repository search found no prior folder-name references outside the preserved historical logs.
Known Issues: One likely test-order or timing-flake remains in the full Vitest run: `AppRoutes.test.tsx` did not find the `Student List` heading once, but passes in isolation. No application source was changed to address it because this task is strictly a path rename.
Next Steps: Investigate the intermittent route-test failure separately if it recurs.
