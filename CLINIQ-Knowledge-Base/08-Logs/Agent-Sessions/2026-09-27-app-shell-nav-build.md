Task: Verify and mark Phase F2 #3 App Shell/Nav Build complete
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue the frontend takeover using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` Phase 1 sequencing after F1 Build completion; the next F2 Student Records item is #3 App Shell/Nav.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-app-shell-nav-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added focused tests proving Staff sees grouped module navigation, Admin/Principal is limited to Dashboard and Reports, and PE/Sports Instructor has no shell navigation groups.
- Marked F2 #3 App Shell/Nav Build complete. Audit remains unchecked per Phase 1 rules.
Reason:
- The shell was built during the Dashboard work but the F2 checklist item still needed explicit Build-state evidence and a resume note.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 13 files / 48 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed, with the known main chunk-size warning.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- App Shell/Nav has not received its Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate pass yet; this is expected until all Phase 1 screens are built.
- Bundle code-splitting should be revisited once routing is chosen.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 1 F2 Student Records with #6 Student List.
