Changes Made: Built the first two F2 screens: `/login` and `/force-password-change`. The frontend-only mock boundary supports synthetic username/password login, generic credential errors, five-failure/30-minute lockout, login audit entries, role-aware redirects, first-login password change, 8-character minimum, recent-password reuse prevention, password-update audit entries, and no idle timeout logic. Connected both screens to the existing route table and application session callback.
Reason: F2 begins with Authentication items #1 and #2. Backend Sanctum does not exist yet, so the implementation is intentionally a replaceable mock adapter and does not claim to provide production authentication or server-side authorization.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed. `npm.cmd test -- --run` passed: 37 test files / 142 tests. `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: Login and Force Password Change Audit boxes remain unchecked until the Phase 2 cross-screen audit and browser-level accessibility evidence are run. Token expiry and authoritative password/lockout enforcement remain Phase B2 backend work.
Next Steps: Continue the F2 audit pass and address the remaining documented F2 UX follow-ups before marking the F2 exit gate complete.
