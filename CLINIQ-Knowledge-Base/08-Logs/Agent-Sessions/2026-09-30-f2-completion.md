Changes Made: Completed the remaining F2 audit follow-ups. Student List rows now include an accessible View profile action and a stable Actions column. Parent Notification Log now shows the selected student's emergency-contact name, relationship, phone, and verification status. Shared QR manual/scanned values now normalize safely to `YYYY-NNNNN`, including partial deletion and paste input. Visit and incident Cancel actions now return to the previous screen and no longer submit the form. All F2 screen Audit boxes and the F2 exit gate are checked in the loop checklist.
Reason: The previous F2 audit record left #6, #17, and #23 open and did not provide a final gate despite all F2 screens having Build boxes checked.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed. `npm.cmd test -- --run` passed: 38 test files / 143 tests. `npm.cmd run build` passed. Source audit covered display privacy, central mock-db access, loading/error/empty states, interaction states, route role boundaries, audit calls, print layouts, and the documented cross-screen flows.
Known Issues: Production Laravel/Sanctum authentication, server-side password history/lockout, database schema, and live API integration remain planned backend work. Browser-level axe execution remains unavailable in this workstation's current browser-driver pairing; existing source-level accessibility checks and the deterministic test suite passed.
Next Steps: Continue with the documented F3 demo-readiness gate and keep the F2 audit record synchronized if later changes affect these screens.
