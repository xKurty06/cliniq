Changes Made: Replaced the unavailable-sign-in message with three labelled prototype buttons for School Clinician, Admin/Principal, and PE/Sports Instructor. The controls select the existing synthetic mock session role and return to the app. The screen explicitly states that it does not authenticate real accounts or use passwords.
Reason: Client-demo presenters need to switch between the existing role-specific views after signing out.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- App.test.tsx` (1 passed); `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed); `npm.cmd run lint` (passed with one pre-existing warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`).
Known Issues: This is intentionally not a real login flow; Laravel Sanctum authentication remains future Phase B2 work.
Next Steps: Replace this prototype picker with the real login screen and Sanctum authentication when Phase B2 begins.
