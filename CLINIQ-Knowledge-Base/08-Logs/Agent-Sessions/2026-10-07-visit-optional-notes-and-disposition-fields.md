Date/Day/Time: Wednesday, October 07, 2026 — 21:50 PHT (system clock)
Agent: Claude Code (Opus 5.5)
Task: Optional visit notes, disposition-specific fields with an excuse-letter draft, and the letter shown on Visit Detail
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Refine the New Visit form and the Visit Detail page: optional notes, disposition-specific fields for the excuse letter, and the letter shown on the visit." (1) Remove the "treatment notes or a medicine" rule everywhere it is enforced (both forms, `createVisit`/`updateVisit` in the data layer, the integrity check); show a quiet "No treatment recorded. You can still save." near Save and "No treatment recorded" on the detail page; the Visit Detail edit form's Complaint uses the same Combobox and normalization as New Visit; follow-up reason stays required. (2) Progressive disclosure: nothing for Returned to class; for Sent home an "Excuse letter" section ("Prepare an excuse letter" on by default, Excused from = today, Excused until required, optional teacher note, validated with `excusedPeriodError`); for Referred to hospital the same plus an optional "Referred to (hospital or clinic)". Fields clear on a disposition change and validate only while visible. Saving stores draft values with the visit, never an approved letter; afterwards offer "Review excuse letter"; approval snapshots the period. One source of truth, and say which wins. A visit with an approved letter edited to another disposition keeps its letter, with a notice. New fields provisional, listed in Issues-and-TODOs. (3) Visit Detail gets a Staff-only "Excuse letter" section (status, period with the profile's formatter, note, link); the profile's "View visit" must land on the same period; show "Referred to". Update seed and tests, Module-Overview Module 3, verify live as Staff and Instructor, run typecheck/tests/build, log, Changelog row. "Don't guess at anything not covered above. Ask instead."

Clarifications asked and answered before editing:
- Teacher note: printed as its own line on the letter, prefilled from the visit draft, editable on the letter page until approval, and snapshotted with the period at approval.
- The Visit Detail edit form gets the same disposition-specific fields as New Visit. When a letter is already approved, its fixed period replaces the draft fields with a notice; "Referred to" stays editable.

Repo state check (AGENTS.md Step 0): fetched all remotes; `main` matched `origin/main` and was clean; `feature/clinic-overview-dashboard` had nothing ahead of `main`. The combobox work (87209d4) had landed on `main`, so NewVisitEntryPage was current. No excused-period ADR exists in `06-Decisions/`; the excused-period rules were read from `Agent-Sessions/2026-10-07-excuse-letter-excused-period.md`.

Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/types/entities.ts`, `lib/mock-db/types.ts`, `seed.ts`: provisional `Visit.excuseLetterDraft`, `Visit.referredTo`, `ExcuseLetterApproval.note`.
- `frontend/src/lib/mock-db/api.ts`: removed `NOTES_OR_LINE` (no other users); new `dispositionFields` check used by `recordVisit` and `updateVisit`; `updateVisit` now normalizes the complaint; `approveExcuseLetter` takes an optional note and clears the visit draft in the same write.
- `frontend/src/lib/mock-db/integrity.ts`: dropped the "needs treatment notes or at least one item given" rule; added draft/referredTo/disposition rules and the draft-beside-approval rule.
- `frontend/src/lib/mock-db/mock-db.json`: every visit gains `excuseLetterDraft: null` and `referredTo: null`; visit-0151 has a pending draft; visit-0142 became Referred to hospital with "Referred to"; visit-0158 has no notes and no items; approvals carry `note`.
- New `features/clinic-visits/ComplaintField.tsx` (shared complaint Combobox), `DispositionFields.tsx` (the disclosed fields), `dispositionValues.ts` (form values, validation, payload).
- `NewVisitEntryPage.tsx`, `VisitDetailPage.tsx` (edit form + new Excuse letter card + Referred to), `ExcuseLetterPage.tsx` (teacher note field and letter line), `api/newVisitApi.ts`, `api/visitDetailApi.ts`, `api/excuseLetterApi.ts`, `lib/itemsGiven.ts` (`visitCareSummary` returns "No treatment recorded" when empty, used by the profile and mobile QR history rows).
- Tests: `VisitDetailPage.test.tsx`, `NewVisitEntryPage.test.tsx`, `ExcusedPeriod.test.ts`, `ExcuseLetterPage.test.tsx`, `ItemsGiven.test.tsx`, `stock.test.ts`, `integrity.test.ts`, `dashboard.test.ts` (fixture fields).
- Docs: `Module-Overview.md` (Module 3), `ADR-018` (dated amendment), `Issues-and-TODOs.md`, `.claude/skills/cliniq-combobox-patterns/SKILL.md`, `Skills-Setup.md`, `Changelog.md`, this log.

Changes Made:
- Which record wins: before approval, the visit's `excuseLetterDraft` is the only stored period and note; the letter page prefills from it. Approval copies the period and note onto the approved letter and sets the draft to null in the same write. From then on the approved letter is the only record, and Visit Detail, the letter page, and the profile all read it. The data layer rejects a draft on a visit whose letter is approved, and the integrity check fails if both exist, so the two can't diverge.
- Approved letter + disposition change: the letter is never changed or deleted. The edit form shows "An approved excuse letter exists for this visit (<period>). This edit doesn't change or remove it, whatever the disposition." in place of the draft fields, and the detail card still shows Approved.
- Skill change (`cliniq-combobox-patterns`), old → new: "New Visit's Complaint is a Combobox" → "the shared `ComplaintField`, used by New Visit and the Visit Detail edit form"; "The data layer applies the same normalization" → "…on create (`recordVisit`) and on edit (`updateVisit`)".
- Audit trail: no new write path. Visit create/update and letter approval still write their existing entries; an edit's summary now names "referred to" / "excuse letter draft" when they change.
- Display privacy: Visit Detail and the letter page are single deliberate lookups (full name); no multi-student list changed.

Reason: Notes were blocking the save of visits where no treatment was given. The disposition decides which follow-on paperwork is relevant, and Staff need to see a visit's letter on the visit itself.

Testing Performed:
- `npm run typecheck`: clean.
- `npm test`: 61 files, 338 tests passed.
- `npm run build`: succeeded.
- `npm run lint`: 1 error and 2 warnings, all pre-existing in files this change did not touch (`ReportIssueModal.tsx`, `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`).
- Live check: the Playwright MCP server wasn't attached to this session, so the same check ran as a Playwright script (scratchpad `playwright-core`, cached Chromium) against `vite` on port 5199 with `?mockPersist=on`. 22 checks passed with no console errors: as Staff, the quiet no-treatment note; no letter fields on Returned to class; letter box ticked on Sent home; "Referred to" only on Referred; "Excused until" required while shown; save offers "Review excuse letter"; the letter page is a Draft prefilled with the note; Visit Detail shows Pending approval, "Referred to", and "No treatment recorded"; after approval it shows Approved with the same period (Oct 7 – Oct 8, 2026); editing to Returned to class shows the notice and keeps the letter; the profile's "View visit" for 2021-00002 lands on a visit showing the same period (Sep 28 – Sep 30, 2026); an edited complaint "  headACHE " saves as "Headache"; no horizontal overflow at 375px. As Instructor, `/visits/visit-0139` redirected to `/qr/scan`, so no letter section showed, and the profile showed no Excuse Letters card.

Known Issues: see "Optional visit notes and disposition-specific fields" in `Issues-and-TODOs.md` (provisional fields, no length limits, edit-form "from" default, letter wording still not stored, profile label after a disposition change, re-audits, canonical drift).

Next Steps: run the Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit on New Visit Entry, Visit Detail/Edit, and Excuse Letter Generator; carry the ADR-018 amendment and the Module 3 wording into the canonical Modules & Features document; settle the fields in the ERD.
