Task: Continue Phase 1 with the remaining QR Digital Health ID screens.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue engineering against the unchecked items in `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/qr-digital-health-id/desktop/QrDesktopHubPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/qr-digital-health-id/desktop/QrPrintPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/EmergencyMobilePage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/routes/paths.ts`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Built and routed the Staff desktop QR lookup hub with shared scanner/manual fallback and Student quick-actions.
- Built the Staff QR print view with selectable student preview, Student Number QR encoding preview, and print-safe sticker layout.
- Built and routed the standalone mobile Emergency Button to Stage 1 incident capture.
- Kept all four Audit boxes unchecked for the ordered Phase 2 pass.
Testing Performed:
- TypeScript check passed.
- Full frontend suite: 29 files, 91 tests passed.
- Production Vite build passed with separate lazy chunks for the new routes.
Known Issues: The print view uses a deterministic frontend mock QR preview until the backend QR generation endpoint is available; it is a Build-phase mock, not production QR issuance.
Next Steps: Continue Phase 1 with the remaining Emergency Response, Reports, User Management, and Backup screens; then run Phase 2 audits in checklist order.
