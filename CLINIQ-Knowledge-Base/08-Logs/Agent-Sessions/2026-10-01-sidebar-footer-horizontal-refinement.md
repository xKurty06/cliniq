Changes Made:
- Changed the expanded footer to one horizontal wrapping row containing Privacy Policy, Report an Issue, the injected version, and HealWare attribution.
- Reduced the visible footer text to 11px for actions and 10px for metadata, retaining the existing lightweight muted treatment and 40px action hit targets.
- Kept the collapsed footer accessible with icon-only actions and stacked metadata.
- Updated the sidebar pattern skill and its Skills Setup entry to document the horizontal footer pattern.
Reason:
The user requested a quieter legal-style footer presentation rather than a vertical or button-like block.
Testing Performed:
- Focused AppShell test: 1 file passed, 8 tests passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
Known Issues:
- None introduced by this visual refinement.
Next Steps:
- None.
