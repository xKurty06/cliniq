Date/Day/Time: Sunday, September 27, 2026 — actual time not available (no system clock access in this environment)
Agent: Claude (chat session)
Task: Revert the barcode-client-question edit to Issues-and-TODOs.md; produce a standalone personal file instead; clean up a cosmetic logging artifact found in the process
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "no, separate md file for my keep only" — correcting the immediately preceding turn, which had attached the client question to the shared Issues-and-TODOs.md rather than producing a standalone personal file as intended.
Files Modified: CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md (reverted), CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md (artifact cleanup + this entry), Client_Discussion_Draft_Barcode_Question.md (new, delivered as a standalone file, NOT part of this vault)
Changes Made:
- Reverted the Issues-and-TODOs.md addition from the immediately preceding turn in full, restoring the barcode scanner item to its prior exact wording.
- Removed the changelog entry and deleted the Agent-Session log file that had documented that now-reverted edit, rather than adding a third layer of "correcting the correction" — since the edit was caught and reversed within the same immediate exchange, before it was ever meaningfully "live."
- While removing that entry, noticed and fixed a real but purely cosmetic bug: several earlier sessions' Changelog entries, generated via a Python heredoc with escaped apostrophes, had accumulated stray repeated quote characters (e.g., "isn'''t" instead of "isn't") across roughly 7 lines. Ran a single regex cleanup pass across the whole file to fix all instances at once — content/meaning unaffected, just a readability fix.
- Produced the actual requested deliverable: a standalone Client_Discussion_Draft_Barcode_Question.md, delivered directly to the user, explicitly NOT copied into this vault or the project zip, per "for my keep only."
Reason: Direct user correction of scope (shared vault vs. personal file), plus an opportunistic fix of an unrelated cosmetic issue found while making that correction.
Testing Performed: N/A — documentation only.
Known Issues: None new.
Next Steps: None for this item — it now lives only in the user's personal file, as intended.
