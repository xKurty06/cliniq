Task: Continue the frontend loop with the Follow-Up List View.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “continue the whole loop engineering”
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/FollowUpListPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/routes/paths.ts`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`

Changes Made:
- Built and routed the Staff Follow-Up List View with status filtering, privacy-safe Student Number rows, visible reason/due-date/status fields, skeleton loading, and empty state.
- Enabled the Follow-Ups navigation item for Staff.
Testing Performed:
- TypeScript typecheck passed.
- Focused inventory and QR tests: 2 files, 4 tests passed.
Known Issues: Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate/Confirm remains pending; the Student Number display currently follows the mock dataset's student ID mapping until backend identifiers are available.
Next Steps: Continue building the remaining unimplemented screens, then run the combined Phase 2 audit across all built screens.
