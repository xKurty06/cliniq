Task: Continue the frontend loop engineering for the active QR mobile hub screen.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “continue the loop engineering”

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-qr-mobile-loop-continuation.md`
Changes Made:
- Reviewed the QR mobile hub and shared scanner against the Screen Inventory, design system, display-privacy, audit-trail, and interactive-state requirements.
- Confirmed the screen is ready to remain Build-complete while its Phase 2 Audit checkbox stays unchecked.
Reason: The active screen is implemented and its verification is green; the loop now moves to the next unchecked Build item until all F1 screens are ready for the combined Audit phase.
Testing Performed:
- Focused QR mobile/shared scanner tests: 2 files, 4 tests passed.
- Full frontend test suite: 28 files, 89 tests passed.
- TypeScript/Vite production build passed.
- Live GitHub page fetch was unavailable from the web cache; repository origin was confirmed locally as `https://github.com/zekuuu/cliniq`.
Known Issues: Phase 2 Countercheck, Audit, Simulate, and Confirm remain pending until the remaining F1 screens are built. The inventory destination behind Dispense Medicine belongs to the later Inventory Tracker build.
Next Steps: Continue Phase 1 with the next unchecked F1 screen, then run the combined Phase 2 audit across all five reference screens after their Build boxes are complete.
