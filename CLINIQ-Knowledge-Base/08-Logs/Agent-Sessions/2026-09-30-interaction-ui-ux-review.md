# Agent Session

Date/Day/Time: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 19:57 (system clock; review started about 19:17)
Agent: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5)
Task: Full interaction-based UI/UX review of the live CLINIQ frontend, screen by screen and role by role, plus fixes for unambiguous bugs and documented-rule violations.
Status: Partial — review completed and 19 issues fixed; 26 findings logged because they need a product or visual decision. Three F2 Audit boxes and the F2/F3 exit checks were re-opened.
Prompt/Request: "Do a full interaction-based UI/UX review of the live CLINIQ frontend, screen by screen, using its actual running site URL — not a static pass… click every button, open every dropdown, submit every form, trigger every state… Test every screen in Screen-Inventory.md, in every role that can access it… Fix anything that's an unambiguous bug or a clear violation of an already-documented rule. For anything that depends on a visual or product judgment call… log it as a follow-up… update any Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md Audit boxes you had to un-check… log the session… add a Changelog row." The request also asked for the Playwright MCP server to be added and the session restarted.

Changes Made:
- **Setup.** Registered the Playwright MCP server in `.mcp.json`. This session is non-interactive and cannot restart to load it, so the review drove the same Chromium build (`ms-playwright/chromium-1228`) through the Playwright library from a scratch script. It was a real browser against the live dev server at `http://localhost:5173`, with genuine clicks, typing, keyboard Tab/Escape, hover, and viewport changes. Step 0: the working tree was clean at `782eb1c` and matched `origin/feature/clinic-overview-dashboard`; `main` has not received this branch's work.
- **Method.** For every route and every allowed role:
  - A per-element sweep: cursor on hover, whether computed styles change on hover, focus indicator while tabbing, native selects, unlabeled fields, text under 12px, horizontal overflow, and console errors.
  - Forced `?mock=slow|empty|error` states.
  - Interaction scripts for every form, approval, confirmation, filter, and toggle.
  - 1440px desktop runs, plus 390px runs for the QR/mobile flows.
  - axe-core (WCAG 2 A/AA plus best-practice) on every route for all three roles.
  
  Screenshots were viewed only to judge layout; none are stored as evidence.
- **Fixes.** 19 issues, all listed in Issues-and-TODOs.md under "Interaction-based UI/UX review — Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 19:55". The main ones:
  - Stage 2 can now reopen a saved incident (`/incidents/:incidentId/complete`).
  - Emergency Stage 1 no longer silently attaches a demo student.
  - The Student Profile Archive action works, behind a confirmation.
  - The Visit and Incident Logs lost their silent 120-row cap and gained pagination.
  - The Incident Log uses the shared date-range pattern.
  - Incident Report vitals have plain labels, and approval is confirmed.
  - The New Visit form clears after save.
  - Add User validates required fields.
  - Error states on the edit forms have a retry.
  - Login uses inline validation.
  - Each screen has one `main` landmark.
  - The mobile QR hub has a logout control and a larger scan button.
  - Kinder sorts first in grade-level lists.
- **Checklist.** Un-checked the Audit boxes for #10, #14, and #18c, then the F2 and F3 exit checks that depend on them. Added re-verification notes to rows whose defects were fixed and re-verified (Student Profile, Incident Entry, QR mobile hub, #15, #18, #34).

Reason: The checklist marked every screen as audited, but those audits were source- and test-level; a note in the F3 closure says no browser run was possible. Using the running app surfaced workflow breaks that a static pass could not see: a reachable form that files data against the wrong student, a lifecycle stage with no way back in, a dead Archive button, and silently truncated lists.

Testing Performed:
- `npx vitest run`: 40 files and 158 tests pass. That's 151 before this session, plus the new regression file and two new Incident Entry cases; two existing Incident Entry tests were updated to pass an explicit Student Number.
- `npx tsc -b` passes.
- `npx eslint .`: 0 errors, and the same two existing Fast Refresh warnings.
- `npm run build` passes.
- Each fix was re-verified live in the browser afterwards:
  - completing a Stage-1 incident from the Incident Log;
  - Emergency → Stage 1 showing the Student Number field;
  - Visit Log paginating all 159 visits;
  - one `main` and one `h1` on every previously flagged screen;
  - plain vital labels;
  - Instructor logout at 390px redirecting to `/login`.

Known Issues:
- 26 logged findings in Issues-and-TODOs.md. The ones needing an owner decision first:
  - PE Referral (#14) has no entry point and no student selection.
  - The Visit Log hides the complaint despite ADR-010.
  - The Follow-Up List lacks Missed/Cancelled actions and a detail view.
  - Screen #4's Staff Dashboard content is missing.
  - Primary-button contrast fails AA (3.74:1), and Design-System.md contradicts itself on it.
  - Date formats and capitalization are inconsistent.
- The Visit Log complaint question was deliberately **not** changed: the code and its test hide the complaint, ADR-010 says to show it, and showing it widens health-data exposure. That call belongs to the owner.
- The review's scratch scripts live outside the repo; no new dependency was added to `frontend/`.

Next Steps:
- Owner decisions on the logged items: at minimum #14's entry point, Visit Log vs ADR-010, #18c's status actions, #4 vs #31, and primary-button contrast.
- Then re-audit #10, #14, and #18c, re-check the F2 and F3 exit boxes, and restart Claude Code once so the registered Playwright MCP server is available to future reviews.
