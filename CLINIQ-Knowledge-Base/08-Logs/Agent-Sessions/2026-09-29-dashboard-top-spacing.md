Task: Increase the top spacing of the main screen content and apply the same spacing to the other screens.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “For the main screen content, adjust the top margin because it is too close to top.” Follow-ups: “Adjust to others too I set it as 12.”, “Wait decreaeto 10 or 8 then increase also bottom.”, and “bottom as 8”.

Changes Made: Standardized screen-level wrappers to `pt-10 pb-8`, while preserving internal component spacing and print overrides.
Reason: The top spacing was reduced from 12 to 10 and the bottom spacing was set to 8 for a balanced page frame.
Testing Performed: `git diff --check` passed after the spacing adjustment. The full frontend suite and build had passed immediately before this class-only adjustment.
Known Issues: None identified.
Next Steps: None.
