Agent: Codex
Task: Split the root README and add plain-language planning summaries.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Build the complete new root README.md for this repo, plus three plain-language summary documents." Preserve the existing uncommitted ADR cleanup and Tech-Stack changes, do not commit this work, verify every new README link, and log the session.
Files Modified:
- README.md
- README_ORIGINAL.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/02-Architecture/Tech-Stack-Summary.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/06-Decisions/Decisions-Summary.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/09-References/Canonical-Documents-Summary.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-readme-and-summaries.md
Changes Made:
- Renamed the former root README without changing its content and created a concise GitHub-facing README with the requested six sections.
- Added short summaries of the accepted decisions, technology choices, and canonical reference documents.
- Kept the existing ADR cleanup, Tech-Stack edits, changelog row, and its session log outside this task's changes.
Reason: Give non-technical teammates a quick entry point while preserving the full planning material needed to write the formal SRS.
Testing Performed: Verified every Markdown link in the new README resolves to a real file, confirmed the README rename preserves the original content, and ran git diff --check.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Review the summaries with the SRS-writing team; commit the documentation changes only when explicitly requested.
