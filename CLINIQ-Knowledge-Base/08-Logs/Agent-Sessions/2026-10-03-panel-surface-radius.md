Task: Standardize the panel-surface radius at 8px
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Change the panel-surface radius from 12px to 8px system-wide; change the shared Card and Modal dialog from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-md`, audit other panel/container surfaces, document the concrete radius mapping, verify live with Playwright, run typecheck, the full test suite, and the build, then log the work.

Changes Made:
- Changed the shared Card and Modal dialog surfaces from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-md`; the Modal close button was already `rounded-md` and remains unchanged.
- Removed Login's obsolete `rounded-md!` override so it inherits the shared Card surface.
- The codebase sweep also found the ErrorState panel and QR camera frame using `rounded-lg`; both now use `rounded-md`.
- Defined the concrete token mapping: panel surfaces and interactive controls use `--radius-md` (8px); badges and menu items use `--radius-sm` (6px). Synced the design-system, both canonical frontend documents, the CSS token comment, and modal component skill.
Reason: A single 8px radius aligns panel surfaces with existing buttons, inputs, and dropdowns, and an explicit mapping prevents future surface/control drift.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd test` — passed: 51 files, 229 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- Live local Chromium verification through Playwright at 1440px: rendered Dashboard stat-card, Student List panel, and Demo Accounts shared Modal each computed to `8px`; captured visual checks outside the repository.
- `git diff --check` and code-level `rounded-lg` sweep — passed; no remaining non-document `rounded-lg` usages.
Known Issues: None introduced. Unrelated concurrent worktree changes were preserved.
Next Steps: None.
