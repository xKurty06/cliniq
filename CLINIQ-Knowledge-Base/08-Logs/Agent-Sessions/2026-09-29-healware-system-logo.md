Task: Use the favicon asset as the shared system logo.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "make the system logo same as the favicon"
Files Modified: `frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`, `frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx`, `.claude/skills/cliniq-sidebar-patterns/SKILL.md`, `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Replaced MCA_Logo.png with Healware_Logo.png in both expanded and collapsed sidebar states; updated the shared-shell test; added the `cliniq-sidebar-patterns` skill and registered it in Skills Setup.
Reason: The user requested that the system logo match the Healware favicon.
Testing Performed: Focused AppShell Vitest suite passed (5 tests); `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd run build` passed; `git diff --check` passed. The skill validator could not run because its Python environment lacks the `yaml` module; the short skill was manually checked for valid frontmatter and scope.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None.
