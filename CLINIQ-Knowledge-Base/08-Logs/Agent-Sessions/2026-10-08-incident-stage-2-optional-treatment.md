Changes Made:
- Removed Incident Stage 2's treatment-notes required marker and “Enter treatment notes.” validation; medicine/supply lines remain optional.
- Added the shared incident-care summary so empty treatment renders as “No treatment recorded” in the Stage 2 completion view, Student Profile, PE/Sports mobile history, and the printable Incident Report.
- Separated treatment from report vitals and added the requested non-blocking warning above the enabled Approve button when both treatment notes and lines are empty.
- Seeded a completed incident with no treatment, and added entry, report, data-layer stock, and integrity regression coverage.
- Updated Module Overview and ADR-018 for the newly decided incident rule.
Reason: Treatment can legitimately be absent after an emergency incident; Staff must still be able to complete and approve the record while receiving a clear final check.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- IncidentEntryPage IncidentReportPage integrity stock` — passed (5 files, 67 tests).
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd test` — 62 files / 345 tests run; 4 pre-existing, time-of-day-sensitive `NewVisitEntryPage` assertions failed just after midnight because a new 00:03 visit sorts before seed visits later the same day. Logged in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`; focused incident coverage passed.
- Live Playwright MCP verification could not run because the configured Playwright MCP server was not exposed to this session. No substitute browser was used.
Known Issues:
- The full-suite New Visit ordering assertions are time-of-day-sensitive shortly after midnight; unrelated to this change and logged for follow-up.
- The canonical Modules & Features document still needs the matching Module 4 update noted in ADR-018.
Next Steps:
- Reconcile the canonical Modules & Features document's Module 4 wording with this approved ADR amendment.
