Task: Update the Report an Issue recipient email and consolidate duplicated resolved-issue headings.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Two small cleanups. Per AGENTS.md Step 0, confirm you're reading the current repo state first. 1. Report an Issue recipient: change ISSUE_REPORT_RECIPIENT in frontend/src/features/issue-reports/reportIssueConfig.ts from team@example.com to zkg.balboa@gmail.com. Update any test that asserts the old address, and resolve the \"Recipient email\" entry under \"Report an Issue follow-up\" in Issues-and-TODOs.md. 2. Issues-and-TODOs.md has several sections titled \"Resolved since last update\" scattered through it. Merge them into one section, newest first, keeping every entry's text and timestamp exactly as written. Don't reword or drop anything. Check for other duplicated headings too, and leave all open sections where they are. Log the session with a real timestamp and add a Changelog row."
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/features/issue-reports/reportIssueConfig.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/issue-reports/ReportIssueModal.test.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-07-report-issue-recipient-and-resolved-log-consolidation.md`
Changes Made:
- Changed the `mailto:` fallback recipient to `zkg.balboa@gmail.com` and updated its modal regression assertion.
- Removed the now-resolved Recipient email follow-up and recorded its resolution at the top of the single consolidated resolved section.
- Consolidated all four `Resolved since last update` sections, newest first. Every pre-existing resolved entry retains its text and timestamp exactly as written.
- Checked exact and normalized headings; no duplicate heading remains.
Reason: The requester designated the actual Report an Issue email recipient and requested a lossless cleanup of duplicated resolved-issue sections.
Testing Performed:
- `npx.cmd vitest run src/features/issue-reports/ReportIssueModal.test.tsx --reporter=verbose`: 1 file / 1 test passed.
- Source-level checks: the old recipient is absent from frontend code and tests; one resolved heading remains; exact and normalized duplicate-heading counts are zero; all 52 pre-existing resolved entries match the prior text exactly.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None.
