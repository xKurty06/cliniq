Task: Show Health Summaries (#21) as a chart, with a table alternative
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "In report health summaries, wont it be better if they are in graph format, or can choose between type of visuals". I recommended a default chart plus a Chart | Table toggle, with both printed, and advised against a chart-type picker because pie/line forms misrepresent this data. The owner replied: "Yes build".
Files Modified:
- cliniq-frontend/src/features/reports/components/HealthSummary.tsx (new)
- cliniq-frontend/src/features/reports/lib/complaintCounts.ts (new)
- cliniq-frontend/src/features/reports/ReportsPage.tsx (health view now renders `<HealthSummary>`)
- cliniq-frontend/src/features/reports/ReportsPage.test.tsx (chart mock + 3 new tests)
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md (#21 build note), 08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made:
- Chart form follows the dataviz method: visits per complaint are magnitudes across categories, so the chart is horizontal bars sorted most to fewest. It's one series, so there's one hue (`brand-green-dark`, contrast already validated in the Design System) and no legend. Bars have rounded data-ends and are anchored flat to the baseline. Hover tooltips read "N visits". The screen-reader label lists every complaint and count.
- Chart | Table toggle uses the shared `SegmentedControl` and is hidden in print.
- A headline line above the chart gives total visits, number of complaint types, and the most common complaint.
- Print: the table always prints. The chart stays mounted off-screen (aria-hidden) in Table view so the canvas has a real size to print, and it renders at 2× pixel ratio so it stays sharp on paper.
- A month with no visits shows an empty state instead of a blank chart or an empty table.
- Table rows are now sorted by count (previously in whatever order complaints first appeared).
- The privacy note was reworded to match what the view actually shows: aggregate counts only, no Student Numbers. The earlier note mentioned Student Numbers in rows this table never had.
Reason: Admin/Principal reads reports and doesn't do data entry, so the ranking should be visible at a glance. The requirement ("Generate/View/Export health summary") doesn't prescribe a format.
Testing Performed:
- `npx vitest run`: 32 files, 102 tests passed, including: chart is the default with an accurate label; the toggle switches to a table sorted by count; both views stay mounted for print; the empty month shows the empty state with no chart or toggle.
- `npx tsc -b`: clean. `npx eslint src/features/reports`: clean. `npm run build`: passed. chart.js is a shared chunk loaded only by Dashboard and Reports; the Reports chunk is 6.9 kB.
Known Issues:
- Not yet checked by eye in a real browser or print preview (jsdom can't draw canvas). Check label fit with long complaint names and the printed layout during #21's Audit.
- Export (CSV) for health summaries still isn't built; "Print / Save as PDF" is the only export path.
Next Steps: Visual and print-preview check during the #21 Audit. Consider the same chart-plus-table pattern for the Monthly Report (#19), e.g. visits per week.
