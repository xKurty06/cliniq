Agent: Claude (chat session)
Task: Set up the full Obsidian knowledge base structure for CLINIQ
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "let's proceed with the obsidian for now, help me setup all the files needed" — plus, to be incorporated before setup: (1) an intuitive-shortcuts/efficiency requirement grounded in software engineering usability principles, (2) reinforcement that every prompt/feature addition or modification must be documented, (3) advance notice that an SRS (DFD, Use-Case Diagram, ERD, Activity Diagram) will be uploaded separately, (4) an "interface construction" development approach — frontend built and shown to the client for feedback before backend finalization.
Files Modified: Entire vault created from scratch — see folder structure in vault root README.md.
Changes Made:
- Built all 10 top-level folders plus Database and Features subfolders.
- Ported and distilled content from the 5 canonical documents (Project Plan, Modules & Features, Frontend Context Brief, Frontend Design Reference, Related Systems Review) into navigable overview files — deliberately not full duplicates, to avoid a second source of truth drifting from the first.
- Added `04-Development/Keyboard-Shortcuts-and-Efficiency.md`, grounding the new shortcuts requirement in Nielsen's "flexibility and efficiency of use" heuristic.
- Added `02-Architecture/Development-Methodology.md` documenting the interface-construction-first approach as ADR-006.
- Created placeholder files in `02-Architecture/Database/` for the ERD, DFD, Use-Case Diagram, and Activity Diagram, since no SRS has been uploaded yet.
- Wrote 6 ADRs in `06-Decisions/` covering the major decisions already made this project (tech stack upgrade, QR redesign, PE Instructor access, display-privacy rule and its correction, Student Number scheme, interface-construction approach).
- Seeded `08-Logs/Changelog.md` from the Project Plan's own revision history (1.0 through 2.1).
- Seeded `08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md` with every genuinely open item already being tracked in conversation (barcode scanner proposal, full calendar ownership, Canteen access, backup layer, nurse-absence coverage, plus the tech-stack confirmations still pending).
Reason: Requested setup, with new requirements folded in before file creation rather than after, per the user's explicit sequencing.
Testing Performed: N/A — documentation only, no code.
Known Issues: SRS diagrams not yet created (waiting on upload). Several tech stack additions (Sanctum, Vite, QR libraries, XAMPP standardization) remain proposed, not confirmed — flagged in Issues-and-TODOs.md, not silently assumed.
Next Steps: Await SRS upload to populate the Database/ diagrams. Await confirmation on the pending tech stack items before any environment setup is executed. First real coding agent session should start by reading AGENTS.md, per the workflow it defines.
