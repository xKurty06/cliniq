Task: Finish all Phase F0â€“F2 audits, then complete Phase F3 loop engineering.

Changes Made:
- Completed the F0â€“F2 countercheck/audit record for shared components and all built frontend screens: privacy, audit-trail calls, interactive states, custom selects, skeleton loading, accessibility semantics, color tokens, route handoffs, and mock-flow simulation.
- Added a visible keyboard-shortcuts help dialog and wired Alt+N, Alt+K, Alt+D, Alt+Q, and Shift+Alt+N. Alt+K focuses the Student List search field; Shift+Alt+N submits the current visit and resets it for another entry.
- Added a route-level skeleton fallback for lazy-loaded screens.
- Added ref forwarding to the shared Input component so shortcut-driven focus is testable and usable.
Reason:
- The request required the documented Frontend-Loop-Engineering Phase 2 audits to be finished after all builds, followed by the F3 polish/demo pass.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test` â€” passed, 31 test files / 94 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` â€” passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` â€” passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` â€” passed with one pre-existing `react-refresh/only-export-components` warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- Remote GitHub reconciliation attempted via `git ls-remote`; blocked by environment network connectivity, so no remote-parity claim is made.
Known Issues:
- The frontend remains mock-backed until the Laravel API, ERD, and production Sanctum authentication phases are implemented.
- The live GitHub check could not connect from this environment.
- The existing Fast Refresh warning remains non-blocking.
Next Steps:
- Get client feedback on the frontend-first mock flow, then proceed with the matching backend phase and resolve the open school-year/grade-promotion decisions before data modeling.
