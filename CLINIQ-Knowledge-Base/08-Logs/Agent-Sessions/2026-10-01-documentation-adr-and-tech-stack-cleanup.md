# Documentation ADR and Tech Stack Cleanup

Date/Day/Time: Thursday, October 01, 2026 — 20:42
Agent: Codex
Task: Fix two documentation gaps found during a routine audit.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Delete the obsolete duplicate session-lifetime ADR only after confirming the real content exists in ADR-015; add the confirmed React Router and plain `useAsyncData` data-fetching libraries to `Tech-Stack.md`; log the session and changelog row; and grep afterward for stale references to the deleted filename.
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/02-Architecture/Tech-Stack.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/06-Decisions/ADR-015-Session-Lifetime-No-Idle-Timeout.md`
- obsolete duplicate session-lifetime ADR (deleted)
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-documentation-adr-and-tech-stack-cleanup.md`
Changes Made: Confirmed ADR-015 contains the canonical session-lifetime decision, removed the obsolete ADR-010 duplicate, removed the stale filename instruction from ADR-015 while retaining its renumbering history, and added the requested Routing and Data fetching rows after Styling in the Tech Stack table.
Reason: Keep the decision records unambiguous and document the two confirmed frontend libraries already used by the project.
Testing Performed: Verified the clean live branch before editing; inspected both ADR contents; confirmed the requested rows and ADR-015 after editing; confirmed the duplicate path is absent; ran a repository-wide stale-reference search, with only immutable historical Agent-Sessions records retaining the former filename.
Known Issues: Historical append-only session logs still mention the former filename as part of the recovery history; they were not edited per repository policy.
Next Steps: None.
