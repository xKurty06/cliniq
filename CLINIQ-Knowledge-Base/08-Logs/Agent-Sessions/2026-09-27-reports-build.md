Changes Made:
- Built a shared print-friendly report workspace covering Monthly Report, Incident Report Archive, and Health Summaries.
- Added month selection, report tabs, summary counts, privacy-safe Student Number archive rows, complaint aggregates, and Print/Save as PDF.
- Enabled Reports navigation for Staff and Admin and added a lazy-loaded `/reports` route.
Testing Performed:
- Full frontend suite: 30 files, 92 tests passed.
- TypeScript/Vite production build passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: Report generation/export is mock-backed and uses the browser print dialog until backend report generation and file export are implemented.
Next Steps: Continue Phase 1 with User Management and Backup, then complete the ordered Phase 2 audits.
