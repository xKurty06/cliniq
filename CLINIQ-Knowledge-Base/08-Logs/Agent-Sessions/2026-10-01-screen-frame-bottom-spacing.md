Task: Increase the shared screen-frame bottom padding.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “make pb-6”
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-screen-frame-bottom-spacing.md`
Changes Made: Changed the central screen-frame bottom-padding override from `pb-4` to `pb-6`; the shared top padding remains `pt-6` and print-specific padding remains excluded.
Reason: The user requested additional bottom breathing room.
Testing Performed: The immediately preceding `npm.cmd run build` passed; this is a one-value CSS adjustment.
Known Issues: None identified.
Next Steps: None.
