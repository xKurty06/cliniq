Task: Final verification of the Dashboard clickable-affordance density revision.
Status: Partial
Prompt/Request: Make the stat figure itself the compact accessible drill-down link, distinguish list-level and row actions, prevent long-label chevron wrapping, update the pattern documentation, verify live with Playwright MCP, and run typecheck, the full test suite, and the build.
Files Modified: `frontend/src/components/ui/StatCard.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/ui/ViewAllLink.tsx`, `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`, this session log.
Changes Made: Corrected the initial compact-stat implementation so each link wraps the visible number and trailing chevron as one `159 ›` affordance, with its accessible `View all [stat label]` name.
Reason: This satisfies the request that the stat figure—not only a nearby icon—be the destination affordance.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- DashboardPage.test.tsx` passed (16 tests); `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd test` passed (49 files, 219 tests); `npm.cmd run build` passed; `git diff --check` passed with no whitespace errors.
Known Issues: Live verification remains blocked: no Playwright MCP is exposed, and the provided Node browser runtime cannot import Playwright after reset/configuration (`The requested module './index.js' does not provide an export named 'default'`). No Microsoft Edge was used.
Next Steps: In a working Playwright MCP/Chromium environment, open the Staff Dashboard and confirm the five figure links, two list-header arrows, and the Oral Rehydration Salts row visually.
