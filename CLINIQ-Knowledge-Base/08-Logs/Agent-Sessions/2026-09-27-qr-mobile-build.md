Task: Build Phase F1 QR Scan/Lookup Hub + Quick-Actions mobile screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue the frontend takeover using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` Phase 1 sequencing after Incident Entry; the next required F1 screen is QR Scan/Lookup Hub + Quick-Actions mobile, including Staff hub, Emergency button, Instructor read-only variant, and a shared scanner wrapper used by all variants.

Changes Made:
- Installed the confirmed `qr-scanner` dependency.
- Added shared `useQrScanner` and `QrScannerView` so camera scan/manual fallback/demo scan logic is not duplicated.
- Added QR lookup mock API by Student Number and wired scan audit entries.
- Built mobile Staff QR flow with scan/manual lookup, standalone Emergency button, Student Summary, Record Visit / Log Emergency / View Full Profile / Dispense Medicine quick-actions.
- Built mobile Instructor lookup variant with full-name deliberate lookup display, allergies/conditions/contact summary, recent visit/incident history, and no action buttons.
- Added `?screen=qr-mobile` and `?screen=qr-mobile&role=instructor` preview paths without choosing a routing library.
- Added focused tests for scanner fallback/demo scan, Staff quick-actions, Instructor read-only behavior, and scan audit entries.
- Checked the QR mobile Build box and filled its Build Resume Note. Audit remains unchecked per Phase 1 rules.
Reason:
- QR mobile is F1 reference screen #4 and establishes the mobile-first scan/manual lookup pattern plus the role-specific Staff/Instructor split.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 12 files / 45 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed. Build now emits separate `qr-scanner` and worker chunks; Vite still reports the main chunk-size warning over 500 kB, to revisit once routing/code-splitting decisions are made.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- QR mobile has not received its Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate pass yet; this is expected until all Phase 1 screens are built.
- The `?screen=qr-mobile` preview switch is temporary until the routing-library decision is made.
- Bundle code-splitting should be revisited once routing is chosen.
Next Steps:
- Phase F1 Build is now complete. Continue Phase 1 into F2 Student Records, starting with #3 App Shell/Nav, then #6 Student List.
