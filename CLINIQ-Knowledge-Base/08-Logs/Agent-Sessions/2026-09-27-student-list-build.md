Task: Build Phase F2 #6 Student List screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Take over from the prior frontend session and continue the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, using the checklist in Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md and proceeding screen by screen.

- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/student-records/StudentListPage.test.tsx`

Changes Made:
- Added the Student List masterlist screen with full-name and Student Number search, grade-level filtering, archived-record inclusion, status badges, empty/error/loading states, and temporary `?screen=student-list` preview wiring.
- Kept the list privacy-safe by showing masterlist identity and record-status fields only; medical details remain inside the individual Student Profile.
- Added focused tests covering masterlist rendering, privacy-safe columns, Student Number search, archived-record visibility, grade filtering, and skeleton loading.
- Marked Phase F2 #6 Student List Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- The frontend loop requires all Phase 1 build checkboxes to be completed before the cross-screen Audit phase begins.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 15 test files / 53 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
Known Issues:
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with #8 Add/Edit Student, then leave all Audit boxes unchecked until the Phase 2 cross-screen pass.
