Files Modified:

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-sidebar-branding-alignment.md`
Changes Made:
- Restored the collapse control to the shared horizontal header and vertically centered it against the three-line brand stack.
- Reduced the decorative Powered by HealWare™ label to 9px and changed it to the muted design token.
- Updated the reusable sidebar pattern to prevent the same layout break on future sidebar work.
Reason:
The separate toggle row disrupted the sidebar's visual hierarchy.
Testing Performed:
- Focused AppShell regression test: 1 file passed, 9 tests passed.
- `prettier --check src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`: passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
Known Issues:
- The unrelated Dashboard calendar TypeScript error currently blocks a whole-project production build.
Next Steps:
- None.
