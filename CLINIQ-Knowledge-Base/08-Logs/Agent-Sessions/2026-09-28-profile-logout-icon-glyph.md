Task: Correct the logout icon glyph.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "fix the icon, it doesnt look like sign out or logout icon"
Files Modified:

Changes Made: Replaced the ambiguous logout glyph with the conventional arrow-leaving-a-door icon.
Reason: The previous glyph did not clearly communicate sign out/logout.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- AppShell.test.tsx` (5 passed); `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None for the icon; authentication wiring remains future Phase B2 work.
