Changes Made:
- Replaced the abrupt canvas-rendered tooltip with a non-interactive HTML tooltip.
- The tooltip now uses short transform/opacity transitions to glide between points and fade in/out while preserving period, count, and cluster-note content.
- Kept reduced-motion support and added regression coverage for the external tooltip configuration.
Reason:
- The prior change animated chart points but could not smoothly transition the canvas tooltip box or its movement between points.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx` (11 passed).
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues:
- None identified for this change.
Next Steps:
- None.
