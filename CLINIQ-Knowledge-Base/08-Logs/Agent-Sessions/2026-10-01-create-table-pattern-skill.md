Task: Create the missing reusable CLINIQ skill for the fixed filtered-table and hidden-caption pattern.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Why haven't you made a skill about it, are you able to read an instructions about it or what so we can fix it”
Files Modified:
- .claude/skills/cliniq-table-patterns/SKILL.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made:
- Added `cliniq-table-patterns` for reusable DataTable behavior across filtered, sorted, paginated, date-range, and report-period views.
- Documented fixed-layout usage, explicit column widths, meaningful accessible captions, semantic table requirements, and focused regression checks.
- Registered the skill in the canonical Skills-Setup table.
Reason: The prior table fix changed a reusable cross-page pattern but did not create the required component skill. This corrects that omission and gives future agents a discoverable instruction source before changing tables.
Testing Performed:
- Read and followed the repository's component-skill rules, existing dropdown/pagination skill format, and the skill-creator instructions.
- Reviewed the new skill for valid frontmatter, focused scope, and references to the shared implementation boundary.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Future table changes should load `cliniq-table-patterns` before editing `DataTable` or a table-consuming screen.
