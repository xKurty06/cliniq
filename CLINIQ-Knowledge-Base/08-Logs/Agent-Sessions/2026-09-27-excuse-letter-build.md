Task: Build Phase F2 #13 Excuse Letter Generator (+ print layout)
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue taking over the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, following Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md screen by screen.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/ExcuseLetterPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/ExcuseLetterPage.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/ExcuseLetterLoading.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/api/excuseLetterApi.ts`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-excuse-letter-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added the Staff-only Excuse Letter Generator screen backed by a mock visit record.
- Added editable recipient/body fields, explicit "not a medical certificate" wording, nurse approval checkbox, approve/store action, and print button.
- Added a printable letter preview whose non-letter controls are hidden in print mode.
- Added mock `approve` audit logging when Staff approves and stores the letter in the student record.
- Added shaped skeleton loading, forbidden/error states, preview routing through `?screen=excuse-letter`, and focused tests.
- Marked Phase F2 #13 Excuse Letter Generator Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- Excuse letter generation is part of the Clinic Visit Monitoring phase and must distinguish clinic excuse letters from out-of-scope hospital-issued medical certificates.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 25 test files / 77 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
Known Issues:
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with #14 PE/Sports Injury Referral Form.
