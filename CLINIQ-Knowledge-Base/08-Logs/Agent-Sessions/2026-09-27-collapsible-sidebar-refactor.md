Task: Refactor the app shell sidebar into a collapsible component.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Now, I want a refactor for the sidebar component, it would be collapsible. There will be an icon on right side of the app name I uploaded the reference icon. then if collapsed, that will be logo only then when hovered, it should be swap to hamburger icon"
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/components/icons/Icon.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-collapsible-sidebar-refactor.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Extracted the desktop sidebar into a dedicated `Sidebar` component.
- Added `AppShell` state for expanded/collapsed sidebar layout.
- Added a collapse control beside the CLINIQ app name using a local inline icon shaped after the provided reference.
- Made the collapsed sidebar logo-only at the top; hover/focus swaps the shield logo to a hamburger icon for expand.
- Kept grouped navigation available in expanded mode and icon-only in collapsed mode.
- Added local `menu` and `sidebarCollapse` icons without adding a dependency.
Reason:
- The sidebar had grown enough behavior and rendering detail that it needed a focused component boundary, and the user requested a collapsible interaction pattern matching a provided visual reference.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run test` in `cliniq-frontend` — 4 test files passed, 26 tests passed.
Known Issues:
- Sidebar links still target `#main-content` until the routing-library decision is resolved and real routes are wired.
Next Steps:
- Visually review the collapse/expand hover behavior in the running Vite app and adjust the icon sizing if the reference icon should read heavier or lighter.
