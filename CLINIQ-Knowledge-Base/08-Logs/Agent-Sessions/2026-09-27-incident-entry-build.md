Task: Build Phase F1 Incident Entry, two-stage screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue the frontend takeover using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` Phase 1 sequencing after New Visit Entry; the next required F1 screen is Incident Entry, two-stage, with Stage 1 and Stage 2 both built and visible status badges.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/IncidentEntryPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/IncidentEntryPage.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/IncidentEntryLoading.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/api/incidentEntryApi.ts`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-incident-entry-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added `IncidentEntryPage` with identified student header, Stage 1 fast-capture form, warning-styled Stage 1 save action, Stage 2 completion form, lifecycle status badges, Stage 1 summary, full vitals, treatment notes, hospital referral fields, parent-notification attempt log, optional follow-up prompt, validation, success states, and shaped skeleton loading.
- Added mock incident context, Stage 1 save, and Stage 2 completion APIs.
- Wired mock audit entries for Stage 1 submit, Stage 2 update, parent notification creation, and optional follow-up creation.
- Added a temporary `?screen=incident-entry` preview path in `App.tsx` without choosing a routing library.
- Added focused tests for Stage 1 render/validation, Stage 1 → Stage 2 completion flow, audit side effects, custom select styling, and loading skeletons.
- Checked the Incident Entry Build box and filled its Build Resume Note. Audit remains unchecked per Phase 1 rules.
Reason:
- Incident Entry is F1 reference screen #3 and establishes the urgent two-stage lifecycle/status pattern used later by incident lists, report views, and emergency-response flows.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 10 files / 41 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed. Vite reported a chunk-size warning over 500 kB after the app gained more screens; no code-splitting change was made because routing remains an explicit open decision.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- Incident Entry has not received its Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate pass yet; this is expected until all Phase 1 screens are built.
- The `?screen=incident-entry` preview switch is temporary until the routing-library decision is made.
- Bundle code-splitting should be revisited once routing is chosen.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 1 with QR Scan/Lookup Hub + Quick-Actions mobile (`features/qr-digital-health-id/mobile/` + `shared/`) including Staff hub, Emergency button, Instructor read-only variant, and a shared scanner wrapper.
