Agent: Codex
Task: Align the Follow-Up status filter with the Follow-up tasks heading.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Move the filter on the right aligned with the title"
Files Modified: `frontend/src/features/emergency-response/FollowUpListPage.tsx`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Moved the Status select into the Follow-up tasks card header's right-aligned actions slot. It is 20rem wide on desktop and becomes full width when the header wraps on small screens.
Reason: Keep the section's filter beside the title for quicker scanning while preserving a usable responsive layout.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd run lint` passed with one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning in `components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`; `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None.
