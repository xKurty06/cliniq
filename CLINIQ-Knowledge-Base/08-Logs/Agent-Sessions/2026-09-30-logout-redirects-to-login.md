# Agent Session

Date/Day/Time: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 12:49
Agent: Codex
Task: Redirect to Login after logout and remove the post-logout screen.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “When logging out, you can now remove the You have logged out screen and redirect to login page instead”
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `frontend/src/App.test.tsx`

Changes Made: Removed the “You have logged out” screen and prototype role-picker buttons. AppShell logout now navigates to `/login` with history replacement, while the existing Login route handles the next sign-in.
Reason: Keep logout behavior aligned with the implemented F2 authentication flow and avoid presenting a separate demo-only sign-in surface.
Testing Performed: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 12:49: `npm.cmd test -- --run` passed with 37 test files / 142 tests; `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: Authentication remains frontend-first mock behavior until Laravel Sanctum is connected.
Next Steps: Include the logout-to-login handoff in the Phase F2 audit.
