Agent: Codex
Task: Integrate the uploaded draft database design into the knowledge base without treating it as approved.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “integrate the draft database design: ERD, data dictionary, reference schema, diagrams; mark as not final.”

Changes Made:
- Preserved the uploaded `ERD.md`, `Data-Dictionary.md`, `Reference-Schema.sql`, and `Diagrams/` contents without rewriting them.
- Replaced live “ERD is TBA” status wording with a clear proposed-draft, not-final, not-approved status and kept migrations explicitly blocked pending team approval.
- Updated the existing ERD issue, added the section 11 migration-blocker decisions, and flagged the MariaDB/XAMPP versus MySQL wording for approval and canonical-document follow-up.
Reason: Keep the knowledge base accurate while preserving the team’s authority to review and approve the proposed design before any backend schema work begins.
Testing Performed:
- Fetched and reviewed all branches and history; `main` and `origin/main` remain at `e63728b`, and the uploaded working-tree ERD is the only post-commit change. The feature branch contains no newer competing ERD edit.
- Rendered all six Mermaid blocks from `ERD.md` with Mermaid CLI 12.0.0; all six parsed successfully.
- Verified all Markdown relative links/images in `ERD.md` and `Data-Dictionary.md`, plus every section 3.0 diagram path, resolve locally.
- Verified 34 `CREATE TABLE` statements in `Reference-Schema.sql`; `ERD.md` and the 34-row data-dictionary table agree.
- Verified the ERD-cited `origin/main` commit, ADRs, repository paths, entity/mock-db files, and 64 exported mock API functions.
Known Issues:
- No local MySQL or MariaDB client/server was available, so the reference SQL was not loaded into an empty database during this session.
- The MariaDB (XAMPP) versus MySQL wording remains an open approval item; no tech-stack, environment, system-architecture, or canonical document was changed.
Next Steps:
- Team review and resolution of ERD.md section 11 decisions D-01 through D-18, then record any approved outcome through the appropriate ADR and canonical-document updates before migrations begin.
