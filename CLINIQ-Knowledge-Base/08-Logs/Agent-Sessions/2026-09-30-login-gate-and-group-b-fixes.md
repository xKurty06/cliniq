# Agent Session

Date/Day/Time: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 22:57 (system clock)
Agent: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5)
Task: (1) Confirm the QR mobile flow requires a real Login before anyone can scan, and fix it if not. (2) Apply the owner's decisions for the UI/UX review's Group B findings.
Status: Partial. The Login gap was found and fixed. 20 of the 21 Group B findings were completed and verified live; 1 (navigation below desktop width) was not covered by the instructions and stays open. Audit boxes #10, #14, #18c and the F2 exit check were re-checked; the F3 exit check stays open for two unfixed out-of-scope bugs.
Prompt/Request: "Apply fixes for all 21 Group B findings from the UI/UX review, plus a separate, more important item: confirm the QR mobile flow actually requires real Login before anyone can scan, not the client-demo role picker… Do this one first… Record this as a short update to ADR-002… Then the 21 findings, sorted into what to build directly versus what to document as a decision first [20 numbered instructions]… For every item above that changes a standing rule (Design-System.md, an ADR, a skill), make that documentation update in the same pass… If ADR-010 turns out not to settle #2 as expected, stop and tell me rather than picking an interpretation." The request also said to keep Playwright MCP connected and not to fall back to a workaround without saying so first.

Changes Made:
- **Step 0 and browser.** The tree was clean at `613a7f8`, in sync with origin. The Playwright MCP server still showed "Pending approval"; MCP servers load only at session start, so this session could not use it either way. That was stated before any fallback. Every live check used the same Chromium build through the Playwright library against `http://localhost:5173`, signing in through the real Login form.
- **Login gate (done first).** Reproduced live with a never-signed-in browser: every route opened (the app defaulted every visitor to the Staff account), `?role=instructor` impersonated any role, the QR hub reopened after Log out, and `/force-password-change?user=<id>` could set any account's password. Fixed at the session level, since the per-route `roles` guards were already correct:
  - A session exists only after Login. It lasts one week (Module 1) and Log out ends it.
  - Without a session, every route redirects to Login, which returns the user to the screen they asked for.
  - The `?role=` override and the unused client-demo role picker were removed.
  - A first-login account gets no session until its password is changed, and that account comes from the verified Login step, never the URL.
  - Recorded as a security clarification in ADR-002.
- **Group B, built as instructed (numbering follows the request):**
  1. PE/Sports Referral is the 5th Student Quick-Action on both hubs, pre-filled.
  2. ADR-010 names the Visit Log under Option A without ambiguity, so the Visit Log now shows the complaint.
  3. Follow-Ups has one status select per pending row; Missed and Cancelled confirm.
  4. The Dashboard has a Staff strip with New Visit and a backup-status indicator.
  5. New Visit asks for the Student Number instead of using a demo student. Incident Stage 1, New Visit, and PE Referral share one field and hook.
  6. Primary buttons are `brand-green-dark`.
  7. One date format, pinned to Philippine time.
  8. Two container tokens, 1200px and 720px.
  9. Title Case button labels.
  10. Plain page titles.
  11. The Shortcuts button moved into the shell header.
  12. No internal ids on the Excuse Letter or Audit Log.
  13. The Incident Report picker lists only reports pending sign-off, and the summary includes referral and notification detail.
  14. "Use PE Defaults" sits beside the fields and fills all five.
  15. The mobile button reads "Emergency".
  16. Backup verification confirms first.
  17. Nothing renders below 12px.
  18. List rows wrap instead of truncating.
  19. The Follow-Ups filter sizes to its content.
  20. Incomplete Records keeps full names, written into the privacy skill.
- **Standing rules updated in the same pass.** Design-System.md gained the corrected button-contrast lines, a 12px minimum, the two containers, which actions confirm, and a "Labels, Titles, Dates & Times" section; the canonical Frontend Context Brief took identical edits. Reference 1 and Screen-Inventory #4, #18c, and #24 were updated with their canonical mirrors. ADR-011 has a dated amendment for the Staff strip.
- **Skills (old → new, for the owner to veto):**
  - `cliniq-display-privacy`: its "Known open question" section still called reason visibility unresolved, although ADR-010 resolved it on September 26. That stale text is the likely reason the Visit Log was built hiding the complaint. Replaced with the ADR-010 decision, and added the Incomplete Records queue as a decided edge case with a test for similar screens.
  - `cliniq-interactive-states`: primary hover was "brand-green fill darkens to brand-green-dark"; now "brand-green-dark fill lightens slightly".
  - `cliniq-dropdown-patterns`: added content-sized triggers and the one-status-select-per-row rule.
  - `cliniq-modal-patterns` (new): confirmations were in use on five screens with no skill. It records only the owner's stated rules (which actions confirm, that the expected outcome doesn't) plus how to use the shared `Modal`.

Reason: Audit Trail accountability depends on every action following a real sign-in, and that was not enforced. The Group B items were the owner's explicit decisions on findings the review had left open.

Testing Performed:
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm test`: 40 files and 186 tests pass, with no unhandled errors (163 before this session).
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors and 1 existing Fast Refresh warning (down from 2, because the Student Number helper moved out of a component file).
- `npm run build` passed.
- **Correction to the previous session's report.** A test added there ("clears a previous Student not found…") started the real `qr-scanner`, which needs a Web Worker jsdom lacks. It raised an unhandled rejection that the pass count did not show, so that run was not fully clean. It is fixed here by stubbing the scanner library in the test file. One new assertion in this session was also briefly vacuous (a `\b` written as a literal backspace); lint caught it and it was corrected.
- Live re-verification:
  - Login gate: seven routes in fresh contexts all redirect to Login; `?role=` is ignored; Staff and Instructor are returned to `/qr/scan` after Login; the scan's audit entry carries the signed-in account (Jennesse Baas, Paolo Sandoval); Log out blocks the next visit; a first-login account cannot reach `/qr/scan` before changing its password. Re-run on the final code.
  - System-wide sweep of every route for Staff (1440px and 390px), Admin (1440px), and Instructor (390px): no text below 12px, no ISO dates, no 24-hour times, no internal ids, only 1200px and 720px containers (448px on the two mobile-first screens), no fixed floating elements, and zero axe violations on desktop.
  - Each item's interaction was repeated in its original role and viewport.

Known Issues:
- **Not covered by the instructions, unchanged:** navigation below the `lg` breakpoint; the uncarded Dashboard header; the Incident Archive's oldest-first order; the desktop QR hub's idle skeleton.
- **Choices made where instructions conflicted or were silent, for the owner to confirm:**
  - Follow-Up "Completed" has no confirmation. Instruction 3 said not to add one; instruction 16 said to add one; instruction 3 was followed as the more specific.
  - Primary-button hover lightens, since no darker brand token exists.
  - The three clinical "Use PE Defaults" texts are placeholder wording for the nurse to confirm.
  - A Stage-1 incident can still be signed off; "pending sign-off" means "not yet approved".
- Page titles were also made Title Case, and Screen-Inventory #18c's sentence about opening a follow-up was rewritten to match the no-detail-screen decision.
- New findings logged: `scrollable-region-focusable` on the Dashboard at 390px; the hand-built duplicate-student dialog does not use the shared `Modal`.
- The Login gate is frontend-only until Phase B2.

Next Steps:
- Owner: confirm or reverse the four choices above, and decide the four uncovered items.
- Fix the desktop QR idle skeleton and move the duplicate-student dialog onto the shared `Modal`; the F3 exit check can then be re-checked.
- Approve the Playwright MCP server once in an interactive `claude` session (`/mcp`).
- Phase B2: enforce login, role access, and password-change ownership server-side; add a human-facing reference number for printed documents.
