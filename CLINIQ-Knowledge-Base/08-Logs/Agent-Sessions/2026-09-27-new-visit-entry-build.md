Task: Build Phase F1 New Visit Entry screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue the frontend takeover using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` Phase 1 sequencing after Student Profile; the next required F1 screen is New Visit Entry, including the Follow-Up prompt and Smart Triage panel, without merging Visit and Incident into a type dropdown.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/NewVisitEntryPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/NewVisitEntryPage.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/NewVisitEntryLoading.test.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/api/newVisitApi.ts`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/lib/mocks/audit.ts`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-new-visit-entry-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added `NewVisitEntryPage` with identified student header, custom-styled complaint select, inline Smart Triage checklist, treatment textarea, disposition segmented control, expandable Follow-Up prompt, validation errors, save loading state, success confirmation, and shaped skeleton loading.
- Added mock visit-context and submit APIs over shared mock data.
- Added mock audit logging helper and wired visit submission/follow-up creation saves to it.
- Added a temporary `?screen=new-visit` preview path in `App.tsx` without choosing a routing library.
- Added focused tests for Smart Triage reveal, inline validation, audit entries on save, custom select styling, and loading skeletons.
- Checked the New Visit Entry Build box and filled its Build Resume Note. Audit remains unchecked per Phase 1 rules.
Reason:
- New Visit Entry is F1 reference screen #2 and establishes the rich data-entry form pattern, including dynamic guidance and inline follow-up capture.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` — passed, 8 files / 36 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed.
Known Issues:
- New Visit Entry has not received its Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate pass yet; this is expected until all Phase 1 screens are built.
- The `?screen=new-visit` preview switch is temporary until the routing-library decision is made.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase 1 with Incident Entry, two-stage (`features/emergency-response/`) including Stage 1, Stage 2, and visible status badge states.
