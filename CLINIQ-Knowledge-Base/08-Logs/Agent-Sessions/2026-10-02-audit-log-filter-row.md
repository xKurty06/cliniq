Task: Audit Log filter row — layout, search, and date-range popover bugs
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Move clear filter align above, shrink those dont need very long drop down like the date range. Also the date range drop down has bugs" — followed by "there should also be a search field".
Files Modified:
- frontend/src/features/audit-log/AuditLogPage.tsx
- frontend/src/features/audit-log/AuditLogPage.test.tsx
- frontend/src/components/ui/DateRangePicker.tsx
- frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitLogListPage.test.tsx
- .claude/skills/cliniq-date-range-patterns/SKILL.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made:
- Audit Log: filter row is now a wrapping flex row — Search (flexible), Date range (content width), User (w-48), Action type / Target (w-48). Clear Filters moved to the card header actions (top-right) and also clears the search. The skeleton matches the new row.
- Search filters the loaded rows on the text the table already shows (user name, action label, target type, target label), so it can't surface hidden student details (cliniq-display-privacy). The entry count and empty state use the searched rows.
- DateRangePicker `customPopover` bugs fixed (also affects Visit Log and Incident Log): the From/To panel was pinned open whenever "Custom range" was the preset (couldn't be dismissed, sat under/over the reopened preset list), choosing Custom immediately applied a 1900→today "custom" range, and there was no Cancel. The popover variant now behaves like the compact one: own open state, applies only on Apply, Cancel/Escape/outside-click close it, and a draft from "All" starts at today rather than 1900-01-01. Added `popoverAlign` ("start" | "end", default "end") so a left-edge picker's panel doesn't overflow leftward.
- Skill cliniq-date-range-patterns: added the popover open/close rule and the `popoverAlign` + content-width guidance (old: popover only had to overlay; new: also dismissable, applies only on Apply, sized to content in filter rows).
Reason: User request; popover bugs reproduced from code and verified fixed in the running app.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b --noEmit` clean; `npx vitest run` — 49 files / 221 tests pass (new: Audit Log search + clear; Visit Log popover Cancel/Apply). Visual check via Playwright at 1440px.
Known Issues: Search is client-side over the fetched rows; when the real backend lands it should move into the audit-log API query.
Next Steps: Consider adding Search to the backend audit-log endpoint in Phase B.

Prompt/Request: "now for target record hyperlink, match it with student hyperlink clickable with icon"
Files Modified: frontend/src/components/ui/ListItemLink.tsx, frontend/src/features/audit-log/AuditLogPage.tsx
Changes Made: The Target record cell's link (previously a page-local underlined link with no icon) now uses the shared `ListItemLink` — the same brand-green, underlined, chevron-icon treatment as the Dashboard's Student Number links. The small target-type label stays above it as plain text; unlinked targets stay plain. `ListItemLink` gained an opt-in `wrap` mode (string children) so long labels such as "Incident · 2022-00001 · Oct 1, 2026 · 12:05 PM" wrap in the fixed-layout table instead of truncating, with the chevron kept on the last word. The default single-line mode is unchanged.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b --noEmit` clean; `npx vitest run` — 49 files / 221 tests pass; visual check at 1440px.

Prompt/Request: "remove the student, incident redundant above"
Changes Made: Removed the small grey target-type label above each Target record cell in AuditLogPage.tsx; the cell is now just the link (or plain label when not navigable). The search still matches the type name.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b --noEmit` clean; `npx vitest run` — 49 files / 221 tests pass.

Prompt/Request: "I think it would be much better if it's just View or open or whatever best"
Changes Made: Target record cells now show the target label as plain text plus a right-aligned `View ›` ListItemLink (sr-only suffix gives it the accessible name "View <target label>", so repeated "View" links stay distinguishable). Unlinked targets stay plain text. No separate Actions column was added — the existing test asserts the read-only audit table has none. ListItemLink's `wrap` mode from the earlier follow-up was reverted (git checkout) since nothing uses it.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b --noEmit` clean; `npx vitest run` — 49 files / 221 tests pass; visual check of the table at 1440px.

Prompt/Request: "replace it with just view"
Changes Made: Navigable Target record cells now render only the `View ›` ListItemLink; the target label survives only as sr-only text in the link's accessible name. Non-navigable targets (e.g. most rows for the Admin viewer) still show their label as plain text, since there is nothing to open. Search and Target-column sorting still use the label.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b --noEmit` clean; `npx vitest run` — 49 files / 221 tests pass.
Known Issues: Sighted users can no longer see which record a navigable entry targets without opening it; sorting by Target record orders rows by a label that is no longer visible.

Prompt/Request: User felt the Audit Log was "missing informations" but couldn't name it. I identified the missing "which record" (lost to the bare "View" link) and proposed: a short-form target, the actor's role, and a "what changed" line. The user replied "yes" to all.
Files Modified: frontend/src/types/entities.ts; frontend/src/lib/mock-db/{api.ts, selectors.ts, integrity.ts, mock-db.json}; frontend/src/features/audit-log/{AuditLogPage.tsx, AuditLogPage.test.tsx}; frontend/src/features/ui-review-regressions.test.tsx; 06-Decisions/ADR-017 + Decisions-Summary; 02-Architecture/Database/ERD.md; 08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md.
Changes Made:
- AuditLogEntry.summary (optional, field names only). Mock `audit()` takes it; `changedSummary()` names the fields that actually changed for student, visit, user, and inventory saves. Fixed summaries: "Changed password", "Completed Stage 2 details", "Marked <status>", "Verified backup". Five seeded update entries got summaries. The validator allows it as an optional non-empty string.
- AuditLogRow: added userRole and summary. The target is now {type, recordType, kind, id, label}, with label a short identifier (Student Number / item / user / report name, or empty). The visit/incident datetime was dropped from the label. incident-stage-* and incident-report now bucket as Incident (they had fallen through to Report and linked to the Reports page). Excuse letters, referrals, and issue reports no longer link to Reports.
- UI: Who = name + ROLE_LABELS role; Action = badge + optional summary; Target = muted kind · ListItemLink identifier (plain bold when not navigable). Search also matches role, summary, and kind. Target sort uses kind + identifier.
- Updated the regression test that locked the old long label format. The "no internal ids" assertion is unchanged.
Testing Performed: tsc clean; vitest 49 files / 222 tests pass; visual check at 1440px (default list and "updated" search).
Known Issues: Canonical Frontend Context Brief §5 still needs the summary field (flagged in Issues-and-TODOs).

Prompt/Request: "it doesn't look appealing maybe add another column or what" (screenshot of the combined Target record cell; it showed the pre-ADR-017 long labels, i.e. a stale HMR module in the user's browser).
Changes Made: Replaced the single Target record column with Module (target.kind, "—" when there's no target) and Record (ListItemLink identifier; "View" when navigable but unlabeled; "No record" when no target). Both are sortable (sort keys module/record). Columns get fixed widths 19/20/20/17/24%. Removed the Issues entry about the combined kind+identifier sort, which is now moot. Updated the regression test's text pattern for the split cells.
Testing Performed: tsc clean; vitest 49 files / 222 tests pass; visual check at 1440px after a fresh reload.
