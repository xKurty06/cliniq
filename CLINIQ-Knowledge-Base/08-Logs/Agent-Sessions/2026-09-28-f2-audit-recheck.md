# Phase F2 Audit Recheck

Date/Day/Time: Monday, September 28, 2026 — 08:12
Agent: Codex
Task: Re-audit every Phase F2 item in the Frontend Loop Engineering checklist.
Status: Partial
Prompt/Request: “Audit everything in Phase F2 now.”
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-28-f2-audit-recheck.md`
Changes Made:
- Reconciled the current feature branch with live GitHub: `origin/feature/clinic-overview-dashboard` matches local `HEAD`; `origin/main` is behind this branch.
- Counterchecked F2 requirements, routes, role guards, shared privacy/audit/interactive-state patterns, loading states, color tokens, and print/mobile route coverage.
- Confirmed Screen #15 Incident Log List is still absent: there is no page, `/incidents` route, or list navigation destination.
- Recorded a second blocker: Screen #20's Incident Report Archive fabricates a “Student Number” from the internal `studentId` rather than resolving the actual `Student.studentNumber`.
- Preserved pre-existing local formatting edits in Backup Status and User Management files; no implementation files were modified.
Reason:
- Phase 2 cannot be certified while a required F2 screen is unbuilt, and the report archive must display the correct privacy-safe identifier.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed (115 modules transformed).
- Static route/navigation, mock-data relationship, audit-call, token, custom-select, skeleton, and accessibility-pattern review.
- `npm.cmd test -- --reporter=dot` and `npm.cmd run lint` began but did not produce completion summaries within the command runner's 30-second window; do not treat them as passed from this session.
Known Issues:
- Screen #15 Incident Log List is missing.
- Screen #20 Incident Report Archive derives an invalid Student Number from `studentId`.
Next Steps:
- Build Screen #15, route `/incidents` to it, and point Incidents navigation there.
- Correct Screen #20 to render the linked student's actual Student Number, then add regression coverage.
- Run the full Phase 2 audit only after every F2 Build box is checked; rerun and capture the complete test and lint results.
