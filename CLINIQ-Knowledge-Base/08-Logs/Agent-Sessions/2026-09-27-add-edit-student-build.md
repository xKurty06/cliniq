Task: Build Phase F2 #8 Add/Edit Student screen
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue taking over the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, following Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md screen by screen.

Changes Made:
- Added the Staff-only Add/Edit Student form using the established card/form pattern.
- Kept Student Number system-assigned and visible as read-only context rather than manually editable.
- Added required-field validation for student identity, emergency contact, allergies, and medical conditions.
- Added add and edit preview modes through `?screen=student-form` and `?screen=student-form&mode=edit`.
- Added duplicate detection by full name plus grade level with a confirmation dialog before creating a duplicate.
- Added mock create/update audit logging and focused tests for validation, duplicate confirmation, audit entries, edit mode, and skeleton loading.
- Marked Phase F2 #8 Add/Edit Student Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- Phase F2 requires the remaining Student Records screens to be built before the cross-screen audit phase begins.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 17 test files / 59 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
Known Issues:
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with #9 Incomplete Records Review Queue.
