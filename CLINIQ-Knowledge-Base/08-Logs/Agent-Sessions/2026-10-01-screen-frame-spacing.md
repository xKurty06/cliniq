Task: Reduce the standard screen-level spacing across the Dashboard and other content wrappers.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Standardized screen-level spacing to `pt-10 pb-8` across the Dashboard and other content wrappers. make it pt-6 pb-4”
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/index.css`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-screen-frame-spacing.md`
Changes Made: Centrally mapped all existing wrappers carrying the established `pt-10 pb-8` pair to `pt-6 pb-4`, covering final, loading, empty, and error variants without duplicating edits across 29 files. The documented print-specific padding override remains excluded.
Reason: The user requested a more compact shared screen frame.
Testing Performed: Confirmed 29 frontend files use the established wrapper pair before the change; `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: None identified.
Next Steps: None.
