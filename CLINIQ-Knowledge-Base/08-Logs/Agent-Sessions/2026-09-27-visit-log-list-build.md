Task: Build Phase F2 #10 Visit Log List
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue taking over the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, following Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md screen by screen.
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitLogListPage.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitLogListPage.test.tsx`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-visit-log-list-build.md`
Changes Made:
- Added the Staff Visit Log List screen with date-range filters, Student Number/grade/event search, and disposition segmented filtering.
- Kept the multi-student list privacy-safe by showing Student Number instead of full name and omitting complaint/treatment text from the table while the reason-visibility decision remains unresolved.
- Added disposition badges, generic visit-record rows, a future-facing View Detail action, shaped skeleton loading, empty/error states, preview routing through `?screen=visit-log`, and focused tests.
- Marked Phase F2 #10 Visit Log List Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- Phase F2 Clinic Visit Monitoring screens are next in the frontend build sequence after Student Records.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 21 test files / 69 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
Known Issues:
- The complaint/reason visibility question for multi-student visit lists remains unresolved and must be decided during the later Audit/decision pass before finalizing list-row content.
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with #12 Visit Detail/Edit.
