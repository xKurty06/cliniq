Agent: Codex
Task: Narrow the rule for creating and updating component skills.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Can you revise the skill or instruction that tell agents to create or edit a skill. It should only create a skill if the agents thinks the component can be repeated to many page, e.g. search bar, drop down, buttons, etc."
Files Modified: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Replaced the trigger of any major/shared component with a reusable cross-page threshold. Agents now create or compare a component skill only when a pattern is already reused or reasonably likely to recur across many pages; page-specific work remains local.
Reason: Avoid creating skills for isolated or merely shared components while retaining durable guidance for broadly reused controls such as search bars, dropdowns, buttons, date pickers, tables, and modals.
Testing Performed: Verified the matching AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md policy diffs; `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Apply the new threshold when considering future component skills.
