Task: Continue the frontend loop from the pasted kickoff operating brief, skipping already-completed setup and build work.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue loop engineering using `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`; the kickoff work has already been partially completed.
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-dashboard-audit-and-f1-reconcile.md`
Changes Made:
- Audited the existing Clinic Overview Dashboard against the documented Reference 1, Screen #31, Module 9, design-system, display-privacy, audit-trail, and interactive-state requirements.
- Confirmed the Dashboard is view-only, so no audit mutation is required; verified privacy-safe Student Numbers, shaped loading/error/empty states, calendar periods, chart table fallback, styled interactive controls, due/upcoming follow-ups, and inventory alerts.
- Marked Dashboard Build and Audit complete.
- Reconciled the already-implemented Student Profile, New Visit Entry, and two-stage Incident Entry as Build-complete; their Audit boxes remain pending for the later ordered Phase 2 pass.
Testing Performed:
- Dashboard focused suite: 3 files, 24 tests passed.
- F1 Student Profile/New Visit/Incident focused suite: 6 files, 14 tests passed.
Known Issues: F1 exit check remains pending until every F1 screen receives its ordered Audit/Simulate/Confirm pass. The broader F2 screens still require build work.
Next Steps: Continue Phase 1/F2 builds until the Build phase is complete, then audit every screen in checklist order.
