Task: Put the All option first and make it the default across CLINIQ filters, including date-range filters.

Changes Made:
- Put All first in the shared DateRangePicker default order and all explicit operational date-range menus.
- Changed the dashboard's initial date range from Last 30 days to All.
- Changed the incomplete-records queue from Open to All by default and moved All to the first segmented option.
- Added an All checkbox as the first, selected-by-default option in MultiSelect; selecting it clears narrower choices.
- Updated tests and the matching bespoke skills/documentation.
Reason: Broad filters should show the complete available record set until the user intentionally narrows it, and the default choice should be visually and keyboard-first.
Testing Performed:
- npm.cmd run typecheck — passed (via the production build's TypeScript step).
- npm.cmd test -- --reporter=dot — 43 files, 199 tests passed.
- Dashboard and dashboard mock-db regression tests — 23 tests passed after bounding All-range trend buckets to recorded history.
- npm.cmd run lint — passed with one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning in `frontend/src/components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- npm.cmd run build — passed.
- `git diff --check` — pending final check.
Known Issues: One pre-existing Fast Refresh lint warning remains in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`, and existing non-blocking `act(...)` warnings remain in Follow-Up tests.
Next Steps: Run the final diff check and review the filter menus visually.
