Task: Add role-aware, navigation-only drill-down behavior to Dashboard stat cards, alert rows, and activity days.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Make the Dashboard's widgets clickable — stat cards, alert-list rows, and the calendar should all navigate to the relevant detail or list screen," then clarified: "keep Admin's Dashboard widgets static — no navigation for Admin on any of them."

Changes Made:
- Staff stat cards now link through existing `paths` builders to Visits, Incidents, Incomplete Records, Inventory, and Students. Admin receives the same static cards.
- Staff follow-up and frequent-visitor rows open the selected Student Profile; the follow-up widget includes a View all link to Follow-Ups. Inventory has no item-detail builder, so Staff inventory rows correctly open the existing Inventory list. Frequent Visitors has no separate flagged-list route/filter, so no misleading View all link was added.
- Staff calendar activity days open an inline counts-and-event-tags summary. Empty/future days and every Admin calendar day remain static.
- Extended shared ListRow/ListCard only enough to support whole-row route links and a non-mutating header link; no resolve, complete, edit, mutation, or audit behavior was added.
- Added Staff navigation and Admin inert-widget regression coverage. Student Numbers remain on Dashboard multi-student lists; routed Student Profiles show the full name only after deliberate single-student lookup, consistent with ADR-004.
Reason: The Dashboard stays view-only under ADR-011 while giving Staff fast navigation into the existing operational screens. Admin retains the current Dashboard/Reports-only access boundary, with no implicit access expansion.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd test -- DashboardPage.test.tsx` — passed (16 tests).
- `npm.cmd test` — passed (49 files, 219 tests).
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — blocked by one pre-existing unrelated `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` error in `features/issue-reports/ReportIssueModal.tsx:53`; it also reports two existing Fast Refresh warnings. No lint issue was introduced by this change.
- Playwright MCP was attempted for Staff/Admin verification, but its Windows sandbox process failed before Chromium opened (`CreateProcessWithLogonW` error 1056); retrying the supplied Node Playwright bridge failed to load its package. Live browser verification could not be completed in this environment. The deterministic role-aware regression tests cover the same Staff links, Admin inert state, and route-access boundary.
Known Issues:
- Playwright MCP/browser startup is unavailable in this environment, so live Staff/Admin interaction verification remains outstanding despite passing deterministic coverage.
- Existing lint error in `frontend/src/features/issue-reports/ReportIssueModal.tsx:53` is outside this task.
Next Steps:
- When the Playwright MCP runtime is restored, verify Staff link destinations and calendar expansion live, then verify Admin has no widget links, activity buttons, or direct access to Staff-only routes.
