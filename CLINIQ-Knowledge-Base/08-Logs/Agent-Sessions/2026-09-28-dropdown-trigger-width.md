Task: Make date-range menus align with their dropdown trigger before sizing to option text.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Wait revise the skill as well as apply it. The size of the box looks weird as it dosnt match the width of the drop down button itself, so make the rule to check first the width size of the drop down button before applying the text length width"
Files Modified: `frontend/src/components/ui/DateRangePicker.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/dashboard/DashboardPage.test.tsx`, `.claude/skills/cliniq-dropdown-patterns/SKILL.md`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Added `min-w-full` to the shared date-range menu before its `w-max` content sizing. Updated the local dropdown skill to require trigger width as the minimum width before considering the longest option.
Reason: Keep the trigger and its menu visually aligned while preventing long option labels from being cramped.
Testing Performed: Targeted Dashboard Vitest suite passed (12 tests); `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Apply the revised local dropdown rule to future custom menus.
