Task: Audit the remaining Phase F0–F2 items in Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md.
Status: Partial
Prompt/Request: "audit the rest now from phase F0-F2 Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md"
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- this session log
Changes Made:
- Reconciled the existing F0–F2 completion claim with the current route table, navigation, screen inventory, and deterministic verification.
- Added the omitted F2 checklist entry for Screen #15 Incident Log List and recorded its absence as an audit blocker.
- Corrected the F2 and F3 exit status to unchecked and recorded that the F1 accessibility-tool exit check lacks evidence.
Reason:
- The phase loop requires an explicit pass/fail result and prohibits checking a box while a known issue remains.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test` — passed: 31 test files, 94 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed with one existing `react-refresh/only-export-components` warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- Static route/navigation audit — no `IncidentLogListPage`, `/incidents` route, or incident-list navigation target found.
- `npm.cmd audit --omit=dev` — could not complete because the npm advisory endpoint/cache was unavailable in this environment.
- GitHub reconciliation was attempted with `git fetch origin`, but sandbox access to `.git/FETCH_HEAD` was denied; the already-configured tracking ref matched local HEAD before the fetch attempt.
Known Issues:
- Screen #15 Incident Log List is missing, blocking F2 and F3 completion.
- An accessibility-tool run is not recorded for the F1 exit check.
- The frontend remains mock-backed pending backend API, production authentication, and ERD work.
Next Steps:
- Build and test Screen #15, add its route/navigation target, then complete the per-screen F2 audit and exit checks.
- Run the prescribed accessibility-tool pass for the F1 reference screens before checking the F1 exit gate.
