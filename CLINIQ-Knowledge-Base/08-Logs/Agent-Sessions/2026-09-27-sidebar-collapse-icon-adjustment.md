Task: Adjust the sidebar collapse icon placement and hover treatment.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "move it a bit right, close to the edge. also remove the bg hover. just the actual icon"
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-sidebar-collapse-icon-adjustment.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Shifted the expanded sidebar collapse control closer to the right edge of the sidebar header.
- Removed the visible hover background from the collapse control so only the icon changes color on hover.
Reason:
- The collapse control needed to sit visually closer to the panel edge and behave more like a minimal icon action than a filled/hover-tile button.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend`
Known Issues:
- None.
Next Steps:
- Visually confirm the icon alignment in the running Vite app.
