Agent: Codex
Task: Verify the Dashboard clickable-affordance density revision.
Status: Partial
Prompt/Request: Verify live with Playwright MCP that the stat cards, list-card headers, and a long-text row such as Oral Rehydration Salts render correctly, and run typecheck, the full test suite, and the build.
Files Modified: `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`, this session log.
Changes Made: Added regression coverage that confirms the five stat links use labelled icon-only figure affordances, the two list-level actions live in their cards’ header elements, and Oral Rehydration Salts uses a truncating label with a non-shrinking chevron.
Reason: The requested visual check needs a deterministic companion so a future change cannot reintroduce crowding or an orphaned chevron.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- DashboardPage.test.tsx` passed (16 tests). `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed. `npm.cmd test` passed (49 files, 219 tests). `npm.cmd run build` passed. `git diff --check` passed with no whitespace errors. Playwright MCP is not exposed in this session; the provided Node browser runtime was reset and pointed at the frontend dependencies, but importing Playwright still failed with `The requested module './index.js' does not provide an export named 'default'`. No Microsoft Edge was used.
Known Issues: Live Chromium/Playwright verification is blocked by the unavailable/misconfigured browser runtime, not by an observed dashboard failure.
Next Steps: Re-run the live Staff Dashboard check in an environment that exposes Playwright MCP or a working Chromium runtime before committing, specifically confirming the five stat figure chevrons, Follow-Ups and Inventory header arrows, and the truncated Oral Rehydration Salts row.
