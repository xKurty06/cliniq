Agent: Claude Code (Opus 5.5)
Task: Add New Visit / New Incident buttons to the Visit Log and Incident Log pages
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "There should be a button new visit or new incident in visits and incidents button not just in dashboard"
Files Modified: frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/VisitLogListPage.tsx (+ .test.tsx), frontend/src/features/emergency-response/IncidentLogListPage.tsx (+ .test.tsx), CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/03-Design/Screen-Inventory.md (#10, #15), 08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made: Confirmed neither list page had a create action. Added a primary header link beside the date-range badge on each, matching the Inventory page's "Add Item" pattern (`buttonClassName({ variant: 'primary' })` on a router Link with an icon): "New Visit" → `paths.visitNew()`, "New Incident" → `paths.incidentNew()` (Stage 1). No student is pre-selected, so each form asks for the Student Number (existing `useIdentifiedStudent` behavior).
Reason: Staff had to go back to the Dashboard to start a record from these pages.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b` clean; Visit Log + Incident Log tests 12/12 pass (new tests assert each header link and its href); ESLint clean on both pages.
Known Issues: None. Not checked live in a browser this time (dev server stopped); the header row uses `flex-wrap`, the same as the Inventory header.
Next Steps: None.
