Date/Day/Time: Saturday, September 26, 2026 — 20:45 (work started 20:14; all times from the system clock)
Agent: Claude Code (claude-opus-5-5), branch `feature/clinic-overview-dashboard`
Task: Build ONLY the Clinic Overview Dashboard (Screen Inventory #31 / Reference 1 / Module 9), extracting genuinely reusable shared components, and run the full Frontend-Loop-Engineering loop
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Build ONLY the Clinic Overview Dashboard page for CLINIQ right now, no other screens. This is deliberate: the Dashboard is the most component-dense screen… every other screen I build after this will reference the components and patterns you establish here… extract genuinely reusable components into a proper shared structure (Button, Card, Badge, StatCard, ListRow, StatusBadge, etc.)." The request listed the eight sources to read in order, required every Reference 1 section (it "has failed review before for having sections silently missing"), required the full build → countercheck → audit → simulate → confirm loop, and asked that shared components and any ambiguous or contradictory source material be called out explicitly rather than handled silently. "Do not guess at requirements… ask me instead."

Decisions asked and answered before building (owner's answers, 20:14):
1. No Vite scaffold existed and Development-Phases §0's two blocking decisions were open → "Scaffold, defer both": scaffold + confirmed deps only; no router and no data-fetching library (a placeholder hook instead).
2. Follow-up rows' "reason" (Reference-Screens specifies it; the display-privacy skill said the question was open) → **Option A, show reason** → ADR-010.
3. Staff resolve/complete actions (implied by Reference-Screens) vs. view-only (Module 9) → **view-only for both** → ADR-011.
4. Stat cards: Reference 1's 3–4 vs. Module 9's "active students" → **all 5** → ADR-011.

Also noted: Development-Phases F1 lists the Dashboard 5th (last). It was built first at the owner's explicit, deliberate request; nothing it depends on was skipped (it needs only F0 pieces, built here).

- .claude/skills/cliniq-display-privacy/SKILL.md (open question → resolved; type-level enforcement note)

Changes Made:
- **F0 foundation:** Vite 8 / React 19 / TS 6 scaffold; the template's oxlint replaced with the confirmed ESLint + Prettier. Tailwind 4 `@theme static` holds exactly the Design-System.md tokens, and Tailwind's default palette is removed so no off-token color can compile. One radius set (4/6/8px), a compact type scale (14px body), and one global focus ring (brand-green-dark, 9.19:1).
- **Shared components** (catalogued in `src/components/README.md`): Button (4-level hierarchy), Card/CardHeader/CardBody, Badge (icon + label always), StatusBadge + domain status maps, StatCard, ListRow/RowList (the Reference 1 list-row pattern), ListCard, SegmentedControl (ARIA radiogroup), DateRangePicker, Input, DataTable (chart fallback), Skeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState, Icon (inline SVG), and chart setup.
- **Privacy by type:** `StudentListRef` (id + studentNumber only). Every dashboard row carries this, never a `Student`, so a name can't be rendered.
- **Dashboard, top to bottom:** header (title, current date, Print/Save as PDF) → date-range filter (presets + validated custom range; default Last 30 days) → 5 stat cards (range-scoped ones labelled with their range, others "Current"; neutral trend vs. the previous equal period) → 3 alert lists (due/upcoming follow-ups: Student Number, reason, due date, Overdue/Due today/Upcoming badge; frequent-visitor warnings: Student Number, visit count, warning badge with a "warning only, not a diagnosis" explainer; low-stock/expiring: item name, stock, separate Low stock / Expires in N days / Expired badges) → common complaints (Chart.js small multiples, top 5, shared scale, weekly/monthly toggle, a warning-colored bar **plus** a drawn ⚠ marker and a text callout for a possible cluster, a table fallback listing every complaint) → calendar (weekly/monthly/yearly toggle, Previous/Today/Next, 4-step brand-green heatmap with a numeric legend, event tags as small text on the day, a tagged-days list in yearly view, a table fallback). Loading skeletons, empty states, and error + retry at page and calendar level. Print CSS hides controls, expands every list, and keeps colors.
- **Mock layer:** one shared deterministic mock clinic (`lib/mocks/dataset.ts`, typed with the §5 entities) and a mock B9 aggregation (`aggregate.ts`) whose undocumented thresholds are isolated in `MOCK_RULES` and labelled as placeholders. `?mock=error|empty|slow` previews the states.

Reason: Owner's request; the Dashboard exercises nearly every component the remaining ~34 screens need.

Testing Performed:
- **Countercheck (pass/fail per source):**
  - Reference 1: header title/date/range filter PASS; stat cards (icon, large number, label, trend) PASS; follow-ups (SN, reason, due date, badge) PASS; frequent visitors (SN, count, warning badge with icon, labelled a warning) PASS; inventory (item name) PASS; trends chart by week/month + cluster marker on the chart PASS; calendar with W/M/Y toggle + heatmap + event tags PASS; export/print PASS; loading/empty/error states PASS.
  - Screen Inventory #31: counts, pending records, trends, cluster flag, frequent visitor by SN, calendar, table fallback for charts PASS.
  - Module 9: active students PASS (5th card); custom date range PASS for range-scoped data (follow-ups and current-state counts are deliberately not range-scoped, labelled on screen); follow-ups computed fresh on each load PASS; export/print PASS; view-only PASS.
  - Mockup corrections (calendar + follow-ups added, tokens not mockup colors) PASS.
- **Audit:** display-privacy PASS (type-enforced; a test asserts none of the 930 mock names appears on the page). Audit trail: N/A, confirmed read-only (a test asserts the only buttons are Print/Previous/Today/Next/Retry). Color tokens PASS (default palette removed; every text/background pair computed, not eyeballed). axe-core 4 (WCAG 2.0/2.1/2.2 A+AA + best practice) in real Chrome: 0 violations in normal, empty, and error states. It first found 1 (duplicate landmark names in ListCard), which was fixed; the remaining "incomplete" contrast items are rows scrolled out of view that use the same passing tokens. Keyboard: a real Tab walk showed logical order and a visible brand-green-dark ring on every control. This also caught a bug where the ring faded in from white on dark toggles, which was fixed. Responsive: no page-level horizontal scroll at 400px after fixing an sr-only overflow bug that affected all scroll containers; screenshots at 1440/500/400 and print-media emulation reviewed.
  - The `better-accessibility` / `claude-a11y-skill` skills named in the loop aren't installed in this repo, so axe-core was used instead (installed in a scratch folder, not added to the project).
- **Simulate:** no other screens exist yet, so shape conformance was checked instead. Mock records and hand-built test fixtures are typed against the §5 entities (Student, Visit, Incident, FollowUp, InventoryItem): a FollowUp → due row, an InventoryItem → alert row, and Visits → frequent-visitor counts / calendar days / complaint buckets all compile and produce the expected rows. The follow-up created by the future New Visit / Incident prompt will appear here as long as it saves `status: 'pending'` and `followUpDate`.
- **Automated:** `npm test`: 3 files, 23 tests pass. `tsc -b`, `eslint .`, `prettier --check .`, and `vite build` are all clean. Bundle: 137 KB gzip JS.
- **Confirm:** PASS. Everything that failed during the loop (landmark names, focus-ring fade, page overflow at 400px, lowercase month label, uneven card heights, print colors) was fixed and re-verified.

Known Issues:
- ADR numbering collision, resolved: another session running concurrently (skeleton-loading + modular-backend logs, same day) created ADR-009-Modular-Backend-Architecture while this build ran. This session's ADRs were renumbered to ADR-010 (reason visibility) and ADR-011 (dashboard scope), and every reference was updated. That session's new universal skeleton-loading rule was checked against this build and is met (page and calendar initial loads use skeletons; refetches keep the previous frame dimmed, per the dataviz guidance).
- Placeholder thresholds (`MOCK_RULES`) are undefined in any document; they need a decision before B9.
- Design-System.md contradicts its own contrast rules in 4 places (primary/secondary button text, text-muted for timestamps, border for inputs). The stricter reading was implemented; the docs need correcting. See Issues-and-TODOs.
- Canonical docs need updates for ADR-010 and ADR-011.
- Whether printing the dashboard is auditable is unconfirmed (currently not logged).
- Brand yellow isn't used on this screen (no meaningful non-decorative use here); the brand identity will mostly come from the App Shell/logo (#3).
- The data-fetching and routing decisions remain open, and `qr-scanner` isn't installed. Modal and App Shell aren't built.
- Nothing has been committed yet; all changes are uncommitted on `feature/clinic-overview-dashboard`.

Next Steps: Owner review of the Dashboard (`npm install && npm run dev` in cliniq-frontend/). Decide the MOCK_RULES thresholds and the Design-System contrast corrections. Update the canonical docs for ADR-010/010. Resolve the data-fetching/routing decisions before the App Shell. Then continue F1 with Student Profile, reusing `src/components/`.

## Addendum: skeleton-loading re-audit (Saturday, September 26, 2026 — 20:59)

Prompt/Request: "Quick addendum before you finish the Dashboard… two documents you were pointed to at the start of this task have been updated since… re-verify against the current versions… run the Audit step again, specifically checking skeleton-loading behavior for every part of the screen that fetches data on load… Each of these should show a skeleton matching its own final shape while loading, not one generic full-page skeleton and not a spinner. If you already implemented this correctly the first time… say so explicitly… If anything's missing, fix it now."

Re-read: `03-Design/Design-System.md` "Feedback & System States" (the universal skeleton rule: "gray placeholder shapes matching the final layout's structure") and `04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md` §4 Audit (the new "Skeleton loading state" checkpoint).

**Audit result for the first implementation: NOT fully correct.** Stated plainly rather than silently re-done:

| Section | First implementation | Verdict | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| No spinner / no blank page | Skeleton, no spinner | PASS | unchanged |
| Stat card row | 5 plain rectangles in the right grid, no internal shape | FAIL (partial) | `StatCardSkeleton` ×5: real icon + label, bars for scope / number / footnote |
| Due/upcoming follow-ups | 1 plain grey block | FAIL | `ListCardSkeleton`: real title + icon, count pill, description lines, 5 two-line rows with meta + badge bars |
| Frequent-visitor warnings | 1 plain grey block | FAIL | `ListCardSkeleton` with one-line rows (matches its loaded rows) |
| Low-stock/expiring inventory | 1 plain grey block | FAIL | `ListCardSkeleton`, two-line rows |
| Trends chart | 1 plain grey block | FAIL | `ComplaintTrendsSkeleton`: real title, toggle-shaped bars, 5 small-multiple frames with baseline-anchored bars |
| Calendar | **Missing** from the page skeleton (it mounted only after the summary resolved), then a plain block | FAIL | Renders independently from the start; `CalendarSkeleton` is shaped per selected view (month: the real day grid with count placeholders; week: 7 day cells; year: 12 mini-month grids) plus a legend bar |

Changes: `Skeleton` fill moved from `surface` (1.09:1 on white cards, barely visible) to the `border` token. New shared `StatCardSkeleton` and `ListCardSkeleton` (exported from `src/components`) for every future card and list screen. Section labels are shared constants between the loaded and loading versions so they can't drift. The calendar is now an independent data section, so it loads in parallel and shows and retries its own error. Refetches after first load still hold the previous render dimmed (not a skeleton flash), per the dataviz guidance; that isn't "load", so the rule's intent is kept. No spinner exists anywhere on the screen; the only spinner in the codebase is `Button`'s `loading` state, which is the rule's stated save/submit exception.

Testing: new `DashboardLoading.test.tsx` holds both requests open and asserts 5 stat-card, 3 list-card (each with its real title and row placeholders), 1 trends skeleton with 5 mini-charts, a month-grid calendar skeleton, 2 screen-reader loading announcements, and no `.animate-spin`. The error-state test was updated for the independent calendar (page and calendar each show their own retry). 4 files / 24 tests pass; tsc, ESLint, Prettier, and build are clean. Visually verified mid-load in Chrome (`?mock=slow`, 1440px): every section shows its own shape.

Confirm: PASS after fix.

## Addendum 2: layout redesign to match the reference mockup (Saturday, September 26, 2026 — 22:08)

Prompt/Request: "The design and layouts doesn't look like the reference", with a crop of the reference mockup's Staff Dashboard and Admin Dashboard.

Asked first (owner's answers):
1. The reference's look depends on the App Shell (#3), which the original brief excluded and which depends on the open routing decision → **"Visual shell, Dashboard only"**: sidebar + top bar as a layout, no router, only Dashboard live, other nav items shown as "Soon" and not clickable, no search box (search doesn't exist yet).
2. Header → **"Greeting, no button yet"**: Staff see "Good morning/afternoon/evening, Nurse Jane!", Admin see "Clinic Overview"; no New Visit button until #11 exists.

Changes:
- **New `src/layouts/AppShell.tsx` + `layouts/navigation.ts`:** white sidebar with the CLINIQ shield wordmark and role-aware nav (Staff: Dashboard, Students, Visits, Incidents, Inventory, Reports, Accounts, in the mockup's order; Admin: Dashboard, Reports). Active item is filled `brand-green-dark` with white text (9.19:1; the mockup's `brand-green` would fail for small text). Top bar has a user chip (initials, name, role). Includes a skip link. Hidden when printing. `src/lib/mocks/session.ts`: mock user; `?role=admin` previews the Admin view.
- **Page:** light `surface` background with white cards (like the reference). The grey filter bar was removed; the period selector now sits top-right in the header next to Print (new `compact` variant of `DateRangePicker`, still with a visible label).
- **Stat cards:** reference layout (small label with icon → large number → one caption line). The low-stock count uses `warning` when above 0 (large text, 4.88:1; the label still carries the meaning).
- **Trends row, now as in the reference:** "Visits trend" line chart with a 10% area wash (2/3 width, weekly/monthly toggle, chart/table toggle) + "Common complaints" labeled horizontal bars (1/3 width). The symptom-cluster marker is drawn on the line (warning point + ⚠ triangle), and the flagged complaint bars are warning-colored with ⚠ + text. The table view keeps the full complaint × period breakdown plus a totals row. This still satisfies Reference 1 item 4: by week/month, bar/line, marker on the chart.
- **Alert lists:** rows restyled to two lines in narrow columns (badge above date on the right); frequent-visitor count moved under the Student Number; descriptions shortened, keeping "a warning only, not a diagnosis".
- **Calendar:** the heatmap ramp was calmed (light tint → `brand-green-light` → `brand-green`, all with dark text ≥ 4.65:1) and cells shortened, so busy weeks no longer paint large saturated blocks.
- **Skeletons** updated to the new shapes (stat card, trend chart frame, complaint rows, list rows).

Kept on purpose, unlike the reference: the Staff mockup's "Recent Visits" table (that belongs to the Staff Dashboard #4, not #31), the search box and bell (not features yet), and the New Visit button (see answer 2). Section order still follows Reference 1 (stats → alerts → trends → calendar).

Testing: 25 tests pass (a new Admin-title test; tests updated for the new layout); tsc/ESLint/Prettier/build clean; axe 0 violations for Staff, Admin, empty, and error; no page-level horizontal scroll at 400px; Staff, Admin, and loading states reviewed in Chrome at 1440px.

Known issues / next: the real App Shell (#3) still needs the routing decision, plus placement of Follow-Ups, QR lookup, and Backup in the nav. The mobile nav below the `lg` breakpoint is a logo-only top bar for now.

## Addendum 3: visual modernization to match the reference (Saturday, September 26, 2026 — 22:22)

Prompt/Request: "It still not look like the reference, it's not modern looking not close to the reference, etc."

Method: rendered 3× zoomed crops of the reference's Staff and Admin dashboards and matched specific traits rather than guessing. The gaps were outlined cards (the reference uses soft shadows and no borders), the system font (the reference uses an Inter-style face), stat cards without colored label/figure, solid heavy badges (the reference uses pale pills), a cramped sidebar with "SOON" tags, thin bars (the reference uses thick rounded bars on one row), a flat trend fill (the reference uses a gradient), and tight spacing.

Changes:
- **Tokens (`src/index.css`):** Inter font self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/inter` (bundled into the build, works offline on the LAN; **new dependency, flagged**); new `--shadow-card` / `--shadow-raised` (neutral near-black at low alpha, no new hue); radius set 6 / 8 / 12px (still one consistent set); `text-3xl` display size for stat figures.
- **`Card` / new `CARD_SURFACE`:** white, rounded-lg, soft shadow, no outline. A border comes back in print and forced-colors modes. Header/body padding increased, and the header divider was removed.
- **`StatCard`:** accent label → large bold figure → caption, with the required icon as a soft tinted chip. New `tone` (brand / error / warning / neutral): visits = brand-green-dark, incidents = error, incomplete records and low stock = warning, active students = neutral (contrast 9.19 / 4.98 / 4.88 at these sizes). Captions shortened; the trend direction word is kept for screen readers.
- **`Badge`:** new `soft` variant (10% tint, icon in the semantic color, text-primary label, since tinted text on a tint would fall below 4.5:1). All status maps now use it.
- **`SegmentedControl`:** selected option is a raised white chip with a brand-green ring (3.43:1 state indicator) and a dark-green label. **Buttons:** soft shadows, 40px height.
- **Shell:** larger nav items (44px), raised active pill, logo tile, school name footer, top bar merged into the page background. The "Soon" tags were removed as visual noise; unbuilt items stay muted and non-clickable, with a "Coming soon" tooltip and a screen-reader "(not available yet)".
- **Trends:** gradient area fill under the line; complaint bars as label | 12px rounded bar | value on one row (brand-green-dark, cluster = warning + ⚠ + text).
- **Calendar:** borderless tiles (empty days = surface tile), wider gaps.
- **Skeletons:** all moved to `CARD_SURFACE` and the new shapes.

Testing: 25 tests pass; tsc/ESLint/Prettier/build clean; axe 0 violations (Staff, Admin, empty, error); no page-level horizontal scroll at 400px; Tab walk shows the skip link first and a visible focus ring on every stop; Staff, Admin, and loading views reviewed in Chrome at 1440px.
