Changes Made:
- Added shared stable comparison and direction-toggle helpers in `lib/tableSort.ts`.
- Added Visit-style accessible sortable headers to every current DataTable's meaningful data columns; action columns remain non-sortable.
- Applied deliberate defaults: newest-first for date/time logs and archives, due-date ascending for follow-ups, and useful alphabetical/count defaults for other tables.
- Preserved sort-before-pagination and reset paginated views to page 1 when sorting changes.
- Added a shared DataTable regression test for the sortable header, `aria-sort`, fixed layout, and hidden accessible caption.
- Updated `cliniq-sorting-patterns` to name Visit Log as the canonical reference and document the shared helper boundary.
Reason: The Visit Log had the desired sorting interaction, but other tables lacked equivalent controls and deterministic ordering. Centralizing the behavior avoids per-screen drift.
Testing Performed:
- npm.cmd run typecheck — passed.
- npm.cmd test -- --reporter=dot — 42 files, 196 tests passed.
- npm.cmd run lint — passed with one existing Fast Refresh warning in `frontend/src/components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- npm.cmd run build — passed.
- `git diff --check` — passed.
Known Issues: Existing non-blocking `act(...)` warnings remain in the Follow-Up tests, and lint reports one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`; no errors were reported.
Next Steps: Review the sortable headers visually on the main list routes.
