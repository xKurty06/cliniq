Task: Align compact Dashboard Visits Trend values to visible horizontal gridlines.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Then also the first point isn't vertically aligned to the horizontal lines"
Files Modified:
- frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.tsx
- frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-08-visits-trend-integer-gridlines.md
Changes Made:
- Small trend ranges (maximum count 12 or lower) now use one-count y-axis steps and show up to 13 tick/grid lines.
- Larger ranges preserve the existing five-line cap to avoid excessive visual density.
- Added regression coverage for the compact-range y-axis configuration.
Reason:
- The previous sparse two-count y-axis interval placed an integer value such as 5 between visible gridlines, making its point appear misaligned.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx` (11 passed).
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues:
- None identified for this change.
Next Steps:
- None.
