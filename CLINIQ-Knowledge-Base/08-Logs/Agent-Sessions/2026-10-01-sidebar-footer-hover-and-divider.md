# Agent Session — Sidebar Footer Hover and Divider

Date/Day/Time: Thursday, October 01, 2026 — 22:51:35 PHT
Agent: Codex
Task: Refine the shared sidebar footer placement, interaction footprint, and item divider.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Make the footer in sidebar lower, also why is it like a button i can immediately hover it even if my mouse hasn't touch the texts", "also for division use the dot middle character", and "reduce spacing, also it's still a button just make it a hyperlink text".
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`
- `frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx`
- `.claude/skills/cliniq-sidebar-patterns/SKILL.md`

- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-sidebar-footer-hover-and-divider.md`
Changes Made:
- Reduced the sidebar bottom inset so the footer sits lower.
- Made expanded-footer items compact text controls: their pointer hit and hover area is only the visible label, so empty surrounding space no longer feels like a button.
- Tightened the horizontal spacing, kept the row unwrapped, and added non-interactive `·` dividers between Privacy Policy, Report an Issue, and the version.
- Retained 40px icon targets only in the collapsed sidebar, where the label is not visible.
- Updated the reusable sidebar pattern and its skills index entry (old: 40px expanded footer target; new: text-only expanded target with `·` dividers).
Reason:
The original expanded footer used 40px-tall flex containers. That made the controls respond before the pointer reached their visible labels and forced the version onto a second line.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx` (1 file, 9 tests passed)
- `git diff --check`
Known Issues:
- Whole-project production builds are currently blocked by an unrelated unused `d` variable in `frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/VisitCalendar.tsx`.
Next Steps:
- None.
