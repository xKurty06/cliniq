Task: Center card-header icons over their title-and-description block.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Also make all icons like in follow-up tasks to cover both the title and the description not just like aligned to the title"
Files Modified: `frontend/src/components/ui/Card.tsx`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Changed the shared CardHeader's leading icon container from top-aligned to vertically centered and removed its title-only offset.
Reason: Icons now visually represent the complete header block, including the supporting description, across all cards using this shared component.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; focused `AppShell` suite passed (5 tests); full suite had 136 passing tests and one unrelated timeout in `IncidentEntryPage.test.tsx`.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None.
