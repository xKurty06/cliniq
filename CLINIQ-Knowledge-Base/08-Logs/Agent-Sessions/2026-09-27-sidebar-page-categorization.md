Agent: Codex
Task: Organize sidebar pages into categories.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Initial request: "Also for the siderbar, please organize and add like categorization for pages." Follow-up refinements: "it should be small light-color, left sided text, just like typical category sidebar" and "smaller, and bit more compact because it's scrollable"
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/navigation.ts`
- `cliniq-frontend/src/components/icons/Icon.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-sidebar-page-categorization.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Replaced the flat sidebar list with grouped navigation sections.
- Added Staff categories: Overview, Student Care, Operations, and Administration.
- Added Admin categories: Overview and Reporting.
- Added disabled module destinations for Follow-Ups, QR Lookup, and Backup so the sidebar reflects the screen inventory without pretending unfinished pages are live.
- Added a QR icon to the local inline icon set for the QR Lookup destination.
- Refined category labels to be small, quiet, and left-aligned like a typical sidebar section label.
- Tightened sidebar vertical spacing and nav row height so the categorized menu is less scroll-heavy.
Reason:
- The sidebar needed clearer page organization so non-technical clinic users can scan available modules by workflow instead of reading one long undifferentiated list.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run test` in `cliniq-frontend` — 4 test files passed, 26 tests passed.
Known Issues:
- Sidebar links still target `#main-content` until the routing-library decision is resolved and real routes are wired.
Next Steps:
- When React routing is chosen, connect each available sidebar item to its real route while preserving the grouped structure.
