Task: Build Phase F2 #9 Incomplete Records Review Queue
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Continue taking over the CLINIQ frontend build loop after the Clinic Overview Dashboard, following Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md screen by screen.

Changes Made:
- Added the Staff-only Incomplete Records Review Queue screen for Registrar-imported records flagged incomplete.
- Added open/resolved/all filters, search by name/Student Number/grade, missing-field badges, imported-by/date context, and session-level resolver tracking.
- Kept the queue privacy-safe by showing missing-field labels only, not actual medical values.
- Added mock `approve` audit logging when a Staff member marks a record reviewed.
- Added shaped skeleton loading, error/empty states, preview routing through `?screen=incomplete-records`, and focused tests.
- Marked Phase F2 #9 Incomplete Records Review Queue Build complete while leaving Audit unchecked for the later Phase 2 pass.
Reason:
- Phase F2 Student Records screens needed to be completed before moving into the next module group and before the later cross-screen audit pass.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run lint` - passed.
- `npm.cmd run test` - passed, 19 test files / 64 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` - passed; Vite still reports the known chunk-size warning after minification.
Known Issues:
- Vite continues to warn that the main bundle is larger than 500 kB; routing/code-splitting remains a later follow-up once routing is decided.
Next Steps:
- Continue Phase F2 with Clinic Visit Monitoring #10 Visit Log List.
