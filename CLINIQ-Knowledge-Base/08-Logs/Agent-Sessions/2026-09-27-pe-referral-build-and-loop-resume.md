Agent: Claude Code (Opus 5.5)
Task: Resume Frontend Loop Phase 1 after the previous agent stopped mid-#14; finish one page, then stop
Status: Completed (one page, per request)
Prompt/Request: "continue the loop engineering, my other agent haven't finish all" — then, mid-session: "after you finish one page, stop"
Files Modified:
- cliniq-frontend/src/features/clinic-visits/PeSportsReferralPage.tsx (removed unused `Badge` import that failed `tsc -b`)
- cliniq-frontend/src/components/ui/Select.tsx, Textarea.tsx, forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx, components/index.ts (new shared components, not yet used by any screen)
- cliniq-frontend/src/lib/mocks/latency.ts (new shared mock-mode/latency helper), src/lib/dates.ts (`formatDateTime`)
- .claude/skills/cliniq-display-privacy/SKILL.md (reason-visibility section now matches ADR-010)
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md, 08-Logs/Changelog.md, 08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md
Changes Made:
- Phase 0 run once (Changelog, ADRs 001–011, Issues, all three bespoke skills).
- #14 PE/Sports Injury Referral Form: the previous agent's files existed but were unlogged and failed typecheck; fixed and checked its Build box.
- Checklist: added #15 Incident Log List and #22 QR Code Print View (listed in Development-Phases.md F2 but missing from the checklist); removed a stray "67" typo.
- Skill drift fix: ADR-010 said the display-privacy skill had been updated, but it still said "open question, stop and ask". Corrected so #15 and #18c don't repeat #10's omission.
- Shared components for the remaining screens (custom-styled Select per cliniq-interactive-states, Textarea, #18b FollowUpPrompt).
Reason: Continue Phase 1 from where it stopped, without building ahead or leaving a failing typecheck.
Testing Performed: `npx tsc -b` clean; `npx vitest run` 27 files / 82 tests passed.
Known Issues: See Issues-and-TODOs.md, "Phase 2 findings logged during Phase 1" (#10 complaint column, #16 follow-up placement, component consolidation, Login/#2 scope).
Next Steps: Next Phase 1 item is #22 QR Code Print View, then #23/#24 desktop hub (extract mobile StudentSummary/StaffActions into `qr-digital-health-id/shared/`), #25 (mobile Emergency button already exists from F1 #4; verify and check off), #15, #17, #18, #18b, #18c, Inventory, Reports, Users, Backup. Use `Select`, `Textarea`, `mockRequest` from the new shared modules.
