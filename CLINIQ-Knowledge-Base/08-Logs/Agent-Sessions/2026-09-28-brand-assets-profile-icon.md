Task: Apply supplied brand assets, an icon-only user profile indicator, and matching expanded/collapsed sidebar logo treatment.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "[MCA_Logo.png](frontend/public/MCA_Logo.png) now use this logo as the sysem logo, then [Healware_Logo.png](frontend/public/Healware_Logo.png) as the favicon. Then for the profile of the user, replace it as the profile icon because there will be no profile picture" Follow-up: "Also the logo when sidebar is collapsed" Follow-up: "It should be same style with expanded sidebar, no bg, no outer outline or box" Follow-up: "Also adjust transfer mendez christian academy below the system name"
Files Modified: `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`, `frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/icons/Icon.tsx`, `frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Set Healware_Logo.png as the PNG favicon; used MCA_Logo.png as the expanded and collapsed system mark; placed Mendez Christian Academy below the CLINIQ name in the expanded brand lockup; replaced user initials with a generic user icon; and removed the collapsed mark's background, shadow, border treatment, and enclosing tile so it matches the expanded logo's plain style.
Reason: Apply the requested official branding and ensure the app does not imply user profile pictures exist.
Testing Performed: Focused AppShell Vitest suite passed (3 tests); `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd run build` passed; `git diff --check` passed. `npm.cmd run lint` completed with one existing, unrelated react-refresh warning in `src/components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Visually inspect the branded shell in the Vite development server if a browser preview is needed.
