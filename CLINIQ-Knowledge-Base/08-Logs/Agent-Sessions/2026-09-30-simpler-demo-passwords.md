Task: Make the frontend demo passwords easier to use.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Make the passwords easier”

- this session log
Changes Made: Replaced the long synthetic passwords with `demo-nurse`, `demo-admin`, `demo-pe`, and `demo-change` across the mock seed, Login sample-account panel, README, and auth tests. Updated the integrity rule to accept only passwords beginning with `demo-` or `dev-only-`, preserving the explicit fake-credential guard.
Reason: Make local client demonstrations faster to operate without turning the sample credentials into plausible production secrets.
Testing Performed: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 12:44: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; focused auth/integrity tests passed with 2 files / 31 tests; `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: These credentials are intentionally visible demo fixtures and must be removed when real Sanctum authentication replaces the mock flow.
Next Steps: Continue the F2 audit with the updated Login credentials and demo disclosure.
