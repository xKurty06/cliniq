Changes Made: Added a visible, labelled Log out button beside the signed-in user's name and role. In the frontend-only mock, clicking it appends the required logout audit entry, clears the mock role selection, and shows a signed-out state. The real Sanctum logout endpoint will replace the mock data-layer action when authentication is built.
Reason: Manual logout is a stated session safeguard and a named audit-trail requirement, especially important because the shared clinic workstation has no idle timeout.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test` (137 passed); `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed); `npm.cmd run lint` (passed with one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning in FollowUpPrompt.tsx); `npm.cmd run build` (passed).
Known Issues: The Login and real Sanctum authentication screens are not built yet, so the signed-out state intentionally does not provide a sign-in form.
Next Steps: Replace `logoutMockSession` with the Sanctum logout request and route the user to Login when Phase B2 authentication is implemented.
