# Agent Session

Date/Day/Time: Tuesday, September 29, 2026 — 09:22
Agent: Codex
Task: Finish all remaining Phase F0 and F1 items in `Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base\\04-Development\\Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md Finish all in phase f0 and f1”
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-29-f0-f1-completion.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made: Marked the central mock-data layer audit, the F0 exit check, and the F1 exit check complete. Added evidence notes covering the centralized API/store boundary, integrity and synchronization tests, role-aware shell behavior, token usage, focused reference-screen coverage, full-suite verification, and production build verification.
Reason: The current frontend implementation already satisfied the remaining F0/F1 gates; the checklist was behind the verified repository state.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- --run` — 36 test files passed, 138 tests passed. `npm.cmd run build` — TypeScript compilation and Vite production build passed.
Known Issues: No new issues found. Backend integration, real authentication, database schema, and production deployment remain future backend work as documented elsewhere.
Next Steps: Proceed with client feedback or the next planned phase; do not treat the mock session as production authentication.
