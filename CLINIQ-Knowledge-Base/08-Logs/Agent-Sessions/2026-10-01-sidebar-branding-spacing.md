# Agent Session — Sidebar Branding Spacing

Date/Day/Time: Thursday, October 01, 2026 — 22:38 PHT
Agent: Codex
Task: Refine the shared sidebar brand lockup and collapse-control spacing.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Move "Powered by HealWare™" below "Mendez Christian Academy," and move the collapse icon farther away because it is too close.
Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`
- `.claude/skills/cliniq-sidebar-patterns/SKILL.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-sidebar-branding-spacing.md`
Changes Made:
- Moved the non-interactive HealWare attribution from the footer into the expanded sidebar brand stack, directly below Mendez Christian Academy.
- Positioned the expanded-sidebar collapse control on its own right-aligned row, leaving clear space around the three-line brand lockup.
- Updated the shared sidebar pattern guidance and skills index to make this the reusable rule.
Reason:
The prior footer attribution did not match the requested brand hierarchy, and the horizontal toggle placement was visibly cramped beside the academy label.
Testing Performed:
- Focused AppShell regression test: 1 file passed, 9 tests passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed before a subsequent unrelated working-tree edit; a final rerun is blocked by `frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/VisitCalendar.tsx:99` (`TS6133`, unused `d`).
- `git diff --check`: passed.
Known Issues:
- The unrelated Dashboard calendar TypeScript error currently blocks a whole-project production build.
Next Steps:
- None.
