Task: Enlarge card-header icons and align the Follow-Up status label with its select control.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Make all icons beside both title and descriptions bigger, same size cover of both of them, then also align status and button horizontally"
Files Modified: `frontend/src/components/ui/Card.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/ui/Select.tsx`, `frontend/src/features/emergency-response/FollowUpListPage.tsx`, this session log, and `Changelog.md`.
Changes Made: Set shared CardHeader leading icons to 32px, vertically centered against their complete text block. Added an optional inline Select layout and used it in Follow-Up tasks so Status and its select trigger align horizontally on desktop, while retaining a stacked mobile layout.
Reason: Strengthen header hierarchy and keep the filter compact and easy to scan.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; `npm.cmd run lint` passed with one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning in `components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`; `git diff --check` passed.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: None.
