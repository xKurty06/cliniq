# Agent Session — Sidebar Footer Completion

Date/Day/Time: Thursday, October 01, 2026 — 13:13 PHT
Agent: Codex
Task: Add the approved version, HealWare credit, and Report an Issue items to the existing Screen #36 sidebar footer.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: Extend the footer established by Screen #36 with a centralized `v0.1.0` version, a non-clickable HealWare credit, and an all-role Report an Issue modal. Save reports in the mock-data layer, open a mailto fallback, audit the create action, update the sidebar pattern skill, verify all roles, and document the work. The mail recipient was allowed to use a placeholder and needed a TODO.

Changes Made:
- Bumped `frontend/package.json` and lock metadata to `0.1.0`; Vite injects the package version through `__APP_VERSION__`, and the sidebar reads it through one `APP_VERSION` constant before rendering `v0.1.0`.
- Added `Powered by HealWare™` as a compact, non-clickable muted attribution below the actual footer actions.
- Added the lightweight `Report an Issue` modal action for all three roles. It captures route, page name, role, and write-time timestamp automatically, leaving only the description for the user to type.
- Added `frontendOnly.issueReports` to the ADR-014 mock-data layer with list/create functions. Creation writes a `create` audit record targeting `issue-report`.
- Added a placeholder `team@example.com` mailto recipient in `reportIssueConfig.ts`; the real address is recorded as an open TODO in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
- Extended `cliniq-sidebar-patterns` from route-only footer guidance to cover modal actions, version/credit blocks, and the Sidebar/AppShell/feature ownership split.
Reason:
The footer additions extend the existing Screen #36 footer block. The report flow stays in a dedicated `features/issue-reports` module while the shared Sidebar remains responsible only for the entry point and AppShell owns modal lifecycle/confirmation.
Testing Performed:
- Full Vitest suite: 48 files passed, 209 tests passed.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; Vite production build completed successfully.
- Live Playwright verification across Staff, Admin/Principal, and PE/Sports Instructor: version and HealWare credit visible; Report an Issue modal opened; context shown; submission saved one `issueReports` record; placeholder mailto was invoked; latest audit entry was `create` targeting `issue-report` for each role.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
Known Issues:
- The mailto recipient is intentionally the placeholder `team@example.com` until the team provides its real address. The TODO is recorded in `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
Next Steps:
Replace the placeholder recipient in `frontend/src/features/issue-reports/reportIssueConfig.ts` when the team contact is designated.
