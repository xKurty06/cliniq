Task: Fix the app navbar color so it matches the sidebar.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Fix the navbar it should be same color as sidebar not the background."
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-navbar-sidebar-color-fix.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Changed the sticky top navbar from the page surface tint to `bg-background`, matching the sidebar's surface token.
- Added a tokenized bottom border so the white navbar remains visually separated from the gray page content while sticky.
Reason:
- The navbar was using the same visual color as the page surface, causing it to blend into the background instead of matching the sidebar.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run test` in `cliniq-frontend` — 4 test files passed, 26 tests passed.
Known Issues:
- None.
Next Steps:
- Recheck visually in the browser during the next UI pass to confirm the navbar/sidebar surface match feels correct across viewport sizes.
