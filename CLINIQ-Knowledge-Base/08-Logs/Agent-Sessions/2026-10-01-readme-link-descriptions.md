Agent: Codex
Task: Add specific descriptions for every README-linked documentation area and file.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Every directory and every individual file linked in the new README needs a real, specific description." Read the linked Project Context and Requirements files before describing them; preserve all prior task requirements.
Files Modified:
- README.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-01-readme-link-descriptions.md
Changes Made:
- Added source-specific two-sentence descriptions for all six README sections.
- Added one specific description for every linked Project Context and Requirements document, plus every other linked README file.
Reason: Let SRS writers decide which source to open without relying on a filename or a generic directory description.
Testing Performed: Read the linked source documents, verified every README Markdown link resolves to a file, and ran git diff --check.
Known Issues: None.
Next Steps: Review the wording with the SRS-writing team; leave all changes uncommitted until explicitly requested.
