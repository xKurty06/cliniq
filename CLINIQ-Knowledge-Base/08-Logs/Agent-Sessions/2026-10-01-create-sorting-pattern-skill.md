Task: Check whether CLINIQ has a sorting skill and add one when the reusable sorting guidance was missing.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “Now is there skill about the sorting”
Files Modified:
- .claude/skills/cliniq-sorting-patterns/SKILL.md
- .claude/skills/cliniq-table-patterns/SKILL.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made:
- Confirmed there was no standalone sorting skill; sorting was only indirectly mentioned by `cliniq-table-patterns`.
- Added `cliniq-sorting-patterns` covering shared sortable headers, controlled state, deterministic comparison, default order, pagination reset, accessibility, and tests.
- Linked sorting and table skills together and registered the new skill in Skills-Setup.
Reason: Sortable list behavior is reusable across operational tables and needs explicit rules beyond the shared DataTable API.
Testing Performed:
- Read the skill-creator instructions, current table skill, DataTable sorting API, and Visit Log sorting tests.
- Manually verified the new skill's frontmatter and scoped guidance.
Known Issues: The bundled Python skill validator requires the unavailable `yaml` package in this environment.
Next Steps: Load `cliniq-sorting-patterns` before adding or changing sortable table columns.
