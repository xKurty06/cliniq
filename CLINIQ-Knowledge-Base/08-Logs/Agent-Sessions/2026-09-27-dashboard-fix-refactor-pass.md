Task: CLINIQ Dashboard fix/refactor pass for design-system alignment and app-wide interactive UX issues
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: The CLINIQ Dashboard was built but needed a fix/refactor pass because it did not match the reference design system. Verify and fix exact design token colors, cursor/hover states everywhere they appear, styled dropdown/select controls, calendar presence/compliance, and shaped skeleton loading. Use Design-System.md, Reference-Screens.md, cliniq-interactive-states, cliniq-display-privacy, and Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md; log the work and update the Dashboard checklist/resume note.

- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.tsx`
Changes Made:
- Verified color tokens against `Design-System.md`; raw hex colors remain confined to `src/index.css` and match the documented token table.
- Added explicit pointer cursors and hover feedback to shared buttons, segmented controls, live nav links, and the date-range select.
- Restyled the date-range select with `appearance-none`, a local chevron icon, token border/radius/focus behavior, pointer cursor, and surface hover feedback.
- Updated `ListRow` so static dashboard alert rows no longer show hover/click affordance; an `interactive` prop now exists for future navigable rows.
- Confirmed the calendar exists and includes weekly/monthly/yearly views, heatmap intensity, event tags, and a table fallback.
- Applied `brand-yellow` to calendar event-tag badges with dark text, matching the token table's accent/badge use.
- Reconfirmed shaped skeleton loading for stat cards, all three alert lists, trends, and calendar; no page-load spinner is used.
- Added a regression test for select styling, pointer classes, static-row non-interactivity, and brand-yellow event-tag badges.
- Aligned stale display-privacy skill and Frontend Loop mockup wording with accepted ADR-010, which keeps reason/description text visible next to Student Number in list rows.
- Updated the Dashboard Frontend Loop checklist/resume note to record this fix pass.
Reason:
- The first Dashboard build missed concrete interaction-state requirements and left the Date range select on native browser styling. The design system now makes these requirements explicit and checkable.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run test` in `cliniq-frontend` — 4 files passed, 26 tests passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend` — passed.
- Source audit with `rg` confirmed no raw hex values outside `src/index.css`; `brand-yellow` is now used for event-tag badges.
Known Issues:
- None for this fix pass.
Next Steps:
- Start F1 #1 Student Profile and reuse the corrected shared controls and interaction-state patterns.
