Task: Correct the stale green Dashboard Visits Trend tooltip after the white-surface update.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "green bg"
Files Modified:
- frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.tsx
- frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-10-08-visits-trend-tooltip-style-refresh.md
Changes Made:
- Moved the tooltip class assignment outside its create-only branch, so a retained tooltip element refreshes to the white panel surface on every hover.
- Added a regression test starting from an existing green tooltip element.
Reason:
- The tooltip is intentionally reused; after hot reload, its old green class persisted because only new elements were assigned the updated white classes.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/features/dashboard/components/ComplaintTrends.test.tsx` (12 passed).
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues:
- None identified for this change.
Next Steps:
- None.
