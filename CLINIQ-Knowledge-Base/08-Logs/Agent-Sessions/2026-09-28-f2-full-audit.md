Changes Made:
- Reconciled GitHub first: remote `a12a0c1` is an ancestor of local `22488e5`; GitHub is stale relative to the current local audit work.
- Counterchecked every F2 screen against Screen Inventory, Reference Screens, ADRs, the three bespoke CLINIQ skills, routes, mock roles, privacy boundaries, loading/error/empty patterns, interaction styling, and mock audit calls.
- Confirmed F2 source/flow pass for #3, #8–#10, #12–#15, #18, #18b, #22, #24–#25, #28–#30, #19–#21, #32–#34. #18c now also passes after correction.
- Fixed #18c Follow-Up List: it now maps each row to the real linked Student Number instead of synthesizing one from an internal ID, and a pending row can be marked complete with a mock audit update. Added regression coverage.
- Did not mark the F2 exit gate complete. #6 Student List still needs stable archived-toggle table geometry and a View Profile row action; #17 needs the relevant parent contact information adjacent to notification controls; #23 needs safe manual Student Number dash insertion. These are already documented in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
- Attempted browser-level axe-core verification. Axe could not start because its ChromeDriver supports Chrome 154 while the installed Chrome is 153.0.8010.54, so no axe result was treated as a pass.
Reason: Phase 2 requires explicit countercheck, audit, simulation, and confirmation across the complete built F2 set. It also prohibits checking the exit gate while known failures or missing verification evidence remain.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test` — 33 files, 103 tests passed.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run build` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — no errors; one existing Fast Refresh warning in `FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- `npm.cmd exec --yes @axe-core/cli http://127.0.0.1:4173/` — inconclusive; ChromeDriver/browser version mismatch prevented execution.
Known Issues:
- The F2 exit gate remains open for #6, #17, and #23's existing documented UX follow-ups and for a successful browser-level axe run.
Next Steps:
- Implement and verify the three documented F2 UX follow-ups.
- Run axe with a ChromeDriver matching Chrome 153 (or update the browser/driver together), then repeat the browser-level accessibility check before closing F2/F3.
