Status: Completed

Changes Made: Replaced the visible logout label with a compact red logout icon directly after the user's name and role. The icon remains a native button with an accessible name, tooltip, focus ring, hover treatment, disabled state, and unchanged audited logout behavior.
Reason: Match the requested lighter-weight header treatment without losing discoverability for assistive technology or keyboard users.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd test -- AppShell.test.tsx` (5 passed); `npm.cmd run typecheck` (passed).
Known Issues: None for this visual refinement. Login and real Sanctum authentication remain future work.
Next Steps: Replace the mock logout function with the Sanctum endpoint when Phase B2 authentication is implemented.
