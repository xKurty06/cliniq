Task: Make the collapsed sidebar hamburger icon-only.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "for collapsed state, hamburger shouldn't inherit the bg color of the logo, just the icon itself"
Files Modified:
- `cliniq-frontend/src/layouts/Sidebar.tsx`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-27-collapsed-hamburger-icon-only.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
Changes Made:
- Moved the collapsed logo's green tile styling from the whole expand button onto the shield icon span only.
- Left the hover/focus hamburger state as a bare icon with no inherited logo background.
Reason:
- The hamburger affordance should read as an icon-only hover state, not as the CLINIQ logo tile with a different glyph inside it.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd run build` in `cliniq-frontend`
- `npm.cmd run lint` in `cliniq-frontend`
Known Issues:
- None.
Next Steps:
- Visually confirm the collapsed hover state in the running Vite app.
