Task: Continue the formal Phase F2 audit with Screen #3 App Shell/Nav.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Continue audit of F2 Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md"
Files Modified:
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md`
- `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-28-f2-app-shell-nav-audit.md`
Changes Made:
- Marked Screen #3 App Shell/Nav as audit-complete with a resumable evidence note.
- Verified Staff navigation exposes the enabled module destinations; Admin exposes only Dashboard and Reports; PE/Sports Instructor receives no desktop shell and redirects to its mobile QR lookup.
- Confirmed active navigation, skip link/main landmark, collapsible-sidebar labels, cursor/hover states, color-token classes, and lazy-route skeleton fallback.
Reason:
- The F2 checklist requires a screen-by-screen Countercheck, Audit, Simulate, and Confirm pass before the F2 exit gate can be completed.
Testing Performed:
- `npm.cmd test -- --run src/layouts/AppShell.test.tsx src/routes/AppRoutes.test.tsx` — passed: 2 files, 11 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint` — passed with the pre-existing `react-refresh/only-export-components` warning in `src/components/forms/FollowUpPrompt.tsx`.
- Static requirements/ADR review plus mock role-route simulation.
Known Issues:
- The route guard and role-aware navigation are intentionally frontend UX controls only; server-side Laravel/Sanctum authorization is scheduled for Phase B2.
- F2 remains incomplete: every remaining unchecked screen still requires its own Phase 2 audit; F1 accessibility-tool evidence also remains outstanding.
Next Steps:
- Continue with the next F2 checklist item, Screen #6 Student List, following the same phase-two process.
