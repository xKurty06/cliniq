Task: Finish all remaining unchecked frontend builds in Phase F2 and check earlier unfinished build items.
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: “finish all remaining unchecked in phase f2, and check also the earlier phases if not finished”; clarified by the requester as build work only, with no audit yet.
Files Modified: `cliniq-frontend/src/features/emergency-response/ParentNotificationPage.tsx`, `IncidentReportPage.tsx`, `cliniq-frontend/src/features/user-management/UserListPage.tsx`, `UserFormPage.tsx`, `cliniq-frontend/src/features/backup/BackupStatusPage.tsx`, `cliniq-frontend/src/components/ui/Modal.tsx`, `cliniq-frontend/src/routes/paths.ts`, `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx`, `src/layouts/navigation.ts`, `CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Frontend-Loop-Engineering.md`, `Development-Phases.md`, `ADR-013-Frontend-Data-Fetching.md`, `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
Changes Made: Built Parent Notification Outcome Logging, Incident Report View/Print, User List, Add/Edit User & Role Assignment, Backup Status, and the missing shared Modal. Added lazy routes and Staff navigation. Marked F0/F2 Build boxes complete only; Audit boxes and F1/F2 exit checks remain untouched. Documented the plain async data-fetching decision.
Reason: Complete the frontend build sequence against the existing mock-data architecture before beginning the separate audit phase.
Testing Performed: `npm.cmd run typecheck`; `npm.cmd test -- --run` — 30 files / 92 tests passed; `npm.cmd run build` passed.
Known Issues: The new screens use mock data until the Laravel backend and finalized database schema are available. No accessibility or cross-screen audit was performed in this session.
Next Steps: Run the Frontend-Loop-Engineering Phase 2 Countercheck/Audit/Simulate/Confirm process when requested.
