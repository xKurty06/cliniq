Task: Create the reusable date-range filtering skill
Status: Completed
Prompt/Request: "Regarding this feature, filter, write the skill about this, so when I implement a feature something like this it will be same and consistent"
Files Modified:
- .claude/skills/cliniq-date-range-patterns/SKILL.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/04-Development/Skills-Setup.md
- CLINIQ-Knowledge-Base/08-Logs/Changelog.md
Changes Made:
- Created `cliniq-date-range-patterns` for reusable multi-record operational-list date filters.
- Recorded the approved pattern: Today, This week, This month, All, and Custom range presets; All as the starting range; draft-only custom dates that require Apply; and a custom panel that overlays rather than reflows the surrounding list/table.
- Pointed agents to the shared `frontend/src/components/ui/DateRangePicker.tsx`, plus the existing dropdown and interaction skills for their respective concerns.
- Added the skill to the current bespoke-skill inventory.
Reason: The user asked to preserve the approved Visit Log filtering behavior for later, similar features.
Testing Performed:
- Manually confirmed the skill has valid YAML frontmatter, a focused trigger description, implementation boundary, and only the user-approved behavior.
- The supplied `quick_validate.py` was attempted but could not run because its Python environment lacks the `yaml` module (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'`).
Known Issues:
- The skill validator cannot run until PyYAML is available in the environment; no project code was affected.
Next Steps: Apply `cliniq-date-range-patterns` whenever a future multi-record operational view receives a date-range filter.
