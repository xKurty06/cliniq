# Agent Session

Date/Day/Time: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 20:19 (system clock)
Agent: Claude Code (Claude Opus 5.5)
Task: Apply fixes for the findings logged by the interaction-based UI/UX review (`2026-09-30-interaction-ui-ux-review.md`). Fix confirmed bugs (Group A); surface judgment calls and decision-dependent items (Group B) without implementing them.
Status: Partial. All 5 Group A findings were fixed and verified live; 21 Group B items await the owner's decision, and the re-opened Audit boxes (#10, #14, #18c) and the F2/F3 exit checks stay unchecked because each depends on a Group B decision.
Prompt/Request: "Apply fixes for the findings from the UI/UX review session logged in Issues-and-TODOs.md… Fix the confirmed bugs. Do not fix the judgment-call items yourself — surface those for a decision instead… Group A — fix these: every finding with severity broken, inconsistent, or cosmetic… Group B — do not fix, decide first: every finding with severity 'judgment call'… plus anything else the review explicitly logged as needing a visual or product decision… Re-verify live… Don't guess at anything a cited source doesn't actually specify — ask instead of picking an interpretation."

Changes Made:
- **Step 0.** The working tree was clean at `9949b60`, in sync with `origin/feature/clinic-overview-dashboard`, and that commit contains the review session's work unchanged.
- **Browser.** The Playwright MCP server in `.mcp.json` shows "Pending approval": project-scoped servers need a one-time approval in an interactive `claude` session, and this session is non-interactive. Live re-verification therefore used the same Chromium build through the Playwright library against `http://localhost:5173`, as the review did.
- **Sorting.** The review logged 26 open findings, and the review heading for its 14 non-judgment items said each "needs a product or scope decision first". I checked each item's cited source to separate real decisions from implementation fixes:
  - *Group A (fix):* items where the fix follows from a source with no open choice. Username uniqueness follows from Module 1 authenticating by username: a duplicate account could never sign in.
  - *Group B (ask):* the 12 judgment calls, plus 9 items where the source leaves the choice open or the review named alternatives. Example: #18c's "Mark a follow-up Completed, Missed, or Cancelled" is an explicit Module-Overview requirement, but no source specifies the control.
- **Fixes (Group A).**
  1. The shared `Modal` now manages focus: it moves into the dialog on open, traps Tab, and restores focus to the opener. It also uses a unique title id.
  2. Duplicate usernames are rejected case-insensitively in the data layer, with an inline form error.
  3. The shared `useAsyncData.reload()` no longer clears loaded data. It now follows the hook's own documented rule of keeping the frame while refetching, which ends the skeleton flash after saving a parent notification (and on Dispense and Profile archive).
  4. The shared `QrScannerView` has an `onScanStart` callback, so both hubs clear a previous lookup error when the camera starts.
  5. Sidebar nav groups are named `role="group"` elements rather than labelled `<section>` landmark regions.
- **Skill check.** No component skill covers the Modal, sidebar nav-group semantics, the scanner, or the async hook; `cliniq-sidebar-patterns` covers only the brand lockup. No skill was wrong, so none was edited.
- **Tests.** Gave the long Stage-2 test in `IncidentEntryPage.test.tsx` an explicit 15 s timeout. It takes about 2.4 s alone and timed out once under full-suite load, so this is a flake fix, not a behavior change.
- **New finding, not fixed.** The desktop QR hub shows a skeleton while idle; logged as a new entry.

Reason: The review logged these as confirmed defects. The user asked to fix the confirmed ones against their cited sources and to ask, not guess, wherever a source leaves the design open.

Testing Performed:
- `npm run typecheck` passed.
- `npm test`: 40 files and 163 tests pass. That's 158 before, plus 5 new regression tests. Each new test was confirmed to **fail** with the pre-fix source stashed and to pass with the fix. An earlier version of the notification test passed even against old code, because mock latency is zero under Vitest; it was replaced by a hook-level test that fails without the fix.
- `npm run lint`: 0 errors, and the same 2 existing Fast Refresh warnings.
- `npm run build` passed.
- Live re-verification, repeating each finding's reproduction in the same role and viewport:
  - Archive and Approve dialogs (Staff, 1440px): focus goes Cancel → Archive record → Close → Cancel, and Escape returns focus to the opener.
  - `/users/new` with `demo.nurse`: inline error, nothing saved.
  - Parent Notifications Add attempt, sampled every 150 ms: `h1` present in every sample with no skeleton, then the success status.
  - Not-found → Scan QR Code on Staff 390px, Instructor 390px, and desktop 1440px: the message is cleared.
  - axe on every route for all three roles: `landmark-unique` is gone. The only remaining violation is primary-button `color-contrast`, which is in Group B.

Known Issues:
- 21 Group B items await owner decisions (listed in Issues-and-TODOs.md under the review subsection).
- The Audit boxes for #10, #14, and #18c, and the F2/F3 exit checks, remain unchecked until those decisions are made and implemented.
- Username uniqueness still needs a database constraint in the backend phase (B2).
- New: the desktop QR hub's idle skeleton (logged, not fixed).

Next Steps:
- Owner decisions on the Group B list; then implement the approved items and re-audit #10, #14, and #18c.
- Approve the Playwright MCP server once in an interactive `claude` session (`/mcp`) so future sessions can use it directly.
