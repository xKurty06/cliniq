# Data Dictionary

**Status: PROPOSED v1, NOT FINAL.** Open decisions in `ERD.md` section 11 can still change tables and columns; do not build migrations from this until the team approves the design. Generated Friday, October 09, 2026 — 02:11 PHT from the reference schema (`Reference-Schema.sql`) after it was loaded into MariaDB 10.11 and passed 107 constraint tests, so the types, keys, indexes and constraints below are exactly what the database accepted. Purposes, mappings and notes are hand-written. If you change the schema, regenerate this file instead of editing it.

How to read it: **Tier** is `Core` (a built screen or the mock already needs it) or `Spec` (the requirements ask for it but the frontend contract does not carry it yet). **Module** is the backend module that owns the table (ADR-009, extended in `ERD.md`). **Frontend** says how the table maps to today's `types/entities.ts`, which is what the API layer must translate. Conventions (keys, times, FK policy) are in `ERD.md` section 2.

## users

**Module:** UserManagement  |  **Tier:** Core

Accounts for Staff, Admin/Principal and PE/Sports Instructor. Never hard-deleted: a leaver is deactivated so history keeps its author.

**Frontend:** `User` (id, name, username, role, lastLogin) + the mock-only `devAccounts` (password, mustChangePassword).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `name` | `varchar(120)` | no |  |  |
| `username` | `varchar(50)` | no |  | Case-insensitive unique (collation). Login looks up by username, so a duplicate could never sign in. Stays reserved after deactivation. |
| `password_hash` | `varchar(255)` | no |  | bcrypt/argon hash from Laravel `Hash`. Never returned by any API. |
| `role` | `varchar(12)` | no |  | `staff` / `admin` / `instructor`. A fourth value (`canteen`) is an additive CHECK change later. |
| `is_head_nurse` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 0 | OPEN (D-04). Module 7 and Module 10 reserve some actions to the "Head Nurse" within Staff. Only meaningful when role = staff. |
| `must_change_password` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | Forces the Force Password Change screen after login. Default 1 for new accounts. |
| `password_changed_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL |  |
| `failed_login_count` | `smallint unsigned` | no | 0 | Reset to 0 on success. At `lockout_max_attempts` (5) the account locks. |
| `locked_until` | `datetime` | yes | NULL | Set to now + `lockout_minutes` (30) when the limit is hit. Login refuses while in the future. |
| `last_login_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL |  |
| `deactivated_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL | Non-null = cannot log in. Rows are kept forever. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** UNIQUE `uq_users_username` (`username`)

**Checks:**

- `chk_users_head_nurse`: `is_head_nurse = 0 or role = 'staff'`
- `chk_users_name_len`: `char_length(trim(name)) >= 1`
- `chk_users_role`: `role in ('staff','admin','instructor')`
- `chk_users_username_len`: `char_length(trim(username)) >= 3`

## password_histories

**Module:** UserManagement  |  **Tier:** Core

The last N password hashes per user, so "no reuse of the last 5" can be checked without storing plaintext.

**Frontend:** Mock keeps this in memory (`passwordHistory`).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `password_hash` | `varchar(255)` | no |  | Compare with `Hash::check` against each row. Prune to `password_history_count` after each change. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_password_histories_user` (`user_id`, `created_at`)

**Foreign keys:** `user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE

## system_settings

**Module:** Shared  |  **Tier:** Core

Tunable thresholds and policy numbers that the requirements leave open, so changing one is a data change, not a deployment.

**Frontend:** `MockDbConfig` in `lib/mock-db/types.ts` (frequentVisitorMinVisits, expiryWarningDays, ...).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `setting_key` **PK** | `varchar(80)` | no |  | Stable code identifier (snake_case). Add new keys in a migration or seeder; read through one settings service with caching. |
| `setting_value` | `varchar(255)` | no |  |  |
| `value_type` | `varchar(8)` | no |  | How to cast `setting_value`. Validation lives in the settings service. |
| `description` | `varchar(255)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `updated_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Foreign keys:** `updated_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_settings_type`: `value_type in ('int','decimal','string','bool')`

## number_sequences

**Module:** Shared  |  **Tier:** Core

Collision-free counters: Student Numbers per enrollment year, and reference numbers for printed documents.

**Frontend:** `nextStudentNumber()` (max + 1) in the mock, which is not safe under concurrent saves.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sequence_name` | `varchar(40)` | no |  | e.g. `student_number`, `excuse_letter`, `incident_report`. |
| `scope` | `varchar(10)` | no |  | The year (`2026`). A new year simply creates a new row, which is what resets the sequence. |
| `last_value` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 | Increment atomically: `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_value = LAST_INSERT_ID(last_value + 1)`, then read `LAST_INSERT_ID()`. Inside the same transaction as the insert that uses it. Gaps after a rollback are acceptable. |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** PRIMARY KEY (`sequence_name`, `scope`)

## grade_levels

**Module:** Shared  |  **Tier:** Core

Ordered list of grade levels. A table, not free text, so a spelling variant can never split a grade, and promotion can be done by sort order.

**Frontend:** `Student.gradeLevel` (string) and `getGradeLevels()`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `name` | `varchar(40)` | no |  |  |
| `sort_order` | `smallint` | no |  | Defines promotion order (Kinder = 0 ... Grade 12 = 12). |
| `is_active` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | Hide a retired level from dropdowns without breaking old students. |

**Indexes:** `idx_grade_levels_sort` (`sort_order`); UNIQUE `uq_grade_levels_name` (`name`)

## complaint_types

**Module:** SmartTriage  |  **Tier:** Core

Predefined complaint labels. Suggestions for the free-text complaint field, and the owner of triage checklists.

**Frontend:** `visitComplaintTypes` and `incidentComplaintTypes` (mock `frontendOnly`).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `label` | `varchar(80)` | no |  | Case-insensitive unique. A visit may still store any text; matching a label is what unlocks its checklist. |
| `used_in_visits` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | Replaces the mock's two separate lists. |
| `used_in_incidents` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 0 | 1 for the incident suggestion list. |
| `is_active` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 |  |
| `sort_order` | `smallint` | no | 0 |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** UNIQUE `uq_complaint_types_label` (`label`)

## triage_steps

**Module:** SmartTriage  |  **Tier:** Core

Ordered first-aid checklist steps per complaint type. Clinical content: edited by the Head Nurse only (Module 7).

**Frontend:** `ComplaintType.triageSteps: string[]`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `complaint_type_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `step_text` | `varchar(255)` | no |  | Clinical protocol text. Needs nurse sign-off before production; the mock's steps are placeholders. |
| `sort_order` | `smallint` | no | 0 |  |
| `is_active` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | Retire a step without deleting history in `triage_checks`. |
| `updated_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_triage_steps_type` (`complaint_type_id`, `sort_order`)

**Foreign keys:** `complaint_type_id` -> `complaint_types`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `updated_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

## student_import_batches

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Core

One row per registrar masterlist import, for traceability and for "which import flagged this record".

**Frontend:** `RecordReview.importedAt` / `importedBy` (mock strings such as "Registrar import").

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `label` | `varchar(80)` | no |  |  |
| `school_year` | `varchar(9)` | yes | NULL | Free label such as `2026-2027`. Nullable until the yearly-import rules are decided. |
| `source_file_name` | `varchar(255)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `source_file_sha256` | `char(64)` | yes | NULL | Unique, so the exact same file cannot be applied twice by accident. |
| `rows_total` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `rows_created` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `rows_updated` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `rows_archived` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `rows_flagged` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `status` | `varchar(8)` | no | applied |  |
| `imported_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `imported_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `notes` | `varchar(500)` | yes | NULL |  |

**Indexes:** UNIQUE `uq_import_batches_file` (`source_file_sha256`)

**Foreign keys:** `imported_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_import_batches_status`: `status in ('applied','failed')`

## students

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Core

The student record. The Student Number is the public identifier (QR, lists, URLs); `id` is internal and never shown.

**Frontend:** `Student` (id, studentNumber, fullName, gradeLevel, contactInfo, archived). `allergies`, `medicalConditions`, `emergencyContact` move to child tables; `recordComplete` is derived.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_number` | `char(10)` | no |  | `YYYY-NNNNN`, unique, IMMUTABLE (the QR code encodes it). CHECK enforces the shape. Generated from `number_sequences`, never by `max()+1`. |
| `full_name` | `varchar(150)` | no |  | Required and non-blank. Single field for now; splitting into last/first/middle waits for the registrar file format (D-15). Accent- and case-insensitive matching comes from the collation. |
| `grade_level_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Nullable on purpose: an imported record may lack it and is then flagged "incomplete". Never nullable for a completed record (rule in the app). |
| `contact_number` | `varchar(60)` | yes | NULL | Nullable for the same reason. "Student contact information" in the requirements. |
| `health_reviewed_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL | OPEN (D-03). Lets "no allergies recorded" mean "asked and none" instead of "never asked". Unused until the team decides. |
| `health_reviewed_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `archived_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL | Non-null = archived (hidden from default lists). Starts the 5-year retention clock. |
| `archived_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `archive_reason` | `varchar(12)` | yes | NULL | `transferred` / `graduated` / `other`. |
| `archive_note` | `varchar(255)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `import_batch_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Set when the record was created by a registrar import. |
| `created_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_students_archived_at` (`archived_at`); `idx_students_grade_archived` (`grade_level_id`, `archived_at`); `idx_students_name` (`full_name`); UNIQUE `uq_students_number` (`student_number`)

**Foreign keys:** `archived_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `import_batch_id` -> `student_import_batches`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `created_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `grade_level_id` -> `grade_levels`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `health_reviewed_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_students_archive_pair`: `archived_at is null and archive_reason is null and archived_by_user_id is null or archived_at is not null`
- `chk_students_archive_reason`: `archive_reason is null or archive_reason in ('transferred','graduated','other')`
- `chk_students_name`: `char_length(trim(full_name)) >= 1`
- `chk_students_number`: `student_number regexp '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{5}$'`

## student_health_entries

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Core

Allergies, food restrictions, conditions, past illnesses and family history, one row each. One table with a `kind`, so adding a kind is a data change.

**Frontend:** `Student.allergies: string[]` (kind `allergy`) and `Student.medicalConditions: string[]` (kind `condition`).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `kind` | `varchar(16)` | no |  | `food_restriction` is what the deferred Canteen role would read, and nothing else. |
| `label` | `varchar(150)` | no |  | Free text (no ingredient database exists). Unique per student + kind, case-insensitive. |
| `note` | `varchar(500)` | yes | NULL | Optional detail such as a reaction. Not shown on glanceable lists. |
| `created_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_health_kind` (`kind`, `label`); UNIQUE `uq_health_entry` (`student_id`, `kind`, `label`)

**Foreign keys:** `student_id` -> `students`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE; `created_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_health_kind`: `kind in ('allergy','food_restriction','condition','past_illness','family_history')`

## emergency_contacts

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Core

Guardians to call in an emergency. The requirements and mock have one; the table allows several with exactly one primary.

**Frontend:** `Student.emergencyContact` (name, relationship, phone, verified): the API returns the primary contact.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `name` | `varchar(120)` | no |  |  |
| `relationship` | `varchar(40)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `phone` | `varchar(30)` | no |  | Required. A contact with no phone counts as incomplete. |
| `is_primary` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | At most one primary per student, enforced by the generated column `primary_student_id` + unique index. |
| `is_verified` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 0 | Denormalized latest state, maintained only by the verification service together with an `emergency_contact_verifications` row. |
| `verified_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL |  |
| `verified_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `primary_student_id` | `bigint unsigned` generated | yes | = if(`is_primary` = 1,`student_id`,NULL) |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_contacts_student` (`student_id`); UNIQUE `uq_contacts_one_primary` (`primary_student_id`)

**Foreign keys:** `student_id` -> `students`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE; `verified_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_contacts_verified`: `is_verified = 0 or verified_at is not null`

## emergency_contact_verifications

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Spec

History of verifying a contact number with the class adviser or Registrar, and of re-flagging it when unreachable in an emergency (Module 2, Parent Contact Validation).

**Frontend:** Not in the mock (it only has `verified: boolean`).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `contact_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `result` | `varchar(10)` | no |  |  |
| `verified_with` | `varchar(100)` | yes | NULL | Free text: who confirmed it (e.g. the adviser's name or "Registrar"). |
| `reason` | `varchar(255)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `incident_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Set when an unreachable call during an incident caused the re-flag. |
| `recorded_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `recorded_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_verifications_contact` (`contact_id`, `recorded_at`)

**Foreign keys:** `contact_id` -> `emergency_contacts`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE; `incident_id` -> `incidents`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `recorded_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_verifications_result`: `result in ('verified','unverified')`

## student_record_reviews

**Module:** StudentRecords  |  **Tier:** Core

The Incomplete Records review queue: who flagged a record, from which import, who resolved it.

**Frontend:** `RecordReview` in `frontendOnly.recordReviews` (the mock uses the string "Flagged in CLINIQ" as a fake importer).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |

| `opened_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `resolved_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `resolved_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL |  |
| `open_student_id` | `bigint unsigned` generated | yes | = if(`resolved_at` is null,`student_id`,NULL) | Generated; unique, so a student has at most one open review. A resolved review stays as history and a new one can open later. |

**Indexes:** `idx_reviews_student` (`student_id`); UNIQUE `uq_reviews_one_open` (`open_student_id`)

**Foreign keys:** `import_batch_id` -> `student_import_batches`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT; `student_id` -> `students`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE; `resolved_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_reviews_resolved`: `resolved_at is null = (resolved_by_user_id is null)`
- `chk_reviews_source`: `source in ('registrar_import','flagged_in_clinic')`

## qr_card_issuances

**Module:** QrDigitalHealthId  |  **Tier:** Spec

A log of QR cards printed or reprinted per student (first issue, lost, damaged).

**Frontend:** Not in the mock.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `reason` | `varchar(12)` | no |  | `first_issue` / `lost` / `damaged` / `other`. This does NOT invalidate older cards; see ERD decision D-02. |
| `issued_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `issued_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_qr_issuances_student` (`student_id`, `issued_at`)

**Foreign keys:** `student_id` -> `students`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE; `issued_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_qr_reason`: `reason in ('first_issue','lost','damaged','other')`

## inventory_items

**Module:** InventoryTracker  |  **Tier:** Core

Medicines and supplies with a maintained stock count. Stock changes only through `inventory_transactions`.

**Frontend:** `InventoryItem`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |

| `category` | `varchar(10)` | no |  |  |
| `unit` | `varchar(30)` | no |  |  |
| `current_stock` | `int` | no | 0 | Signed: it can go negative because over-stock dispensing warns but never blocks (Module 8). Updated in the same transaction as the ledger row, under a row lock. |
| `low_stock_threshold` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `expiration_date` | `date` | yes | NULL | One date per item (not per batch), changed only by Restock. Null = never expires. |

## visits

**Module:** ClinicVisits  |  **Tier:** Core

A routine clinic visit. Cannot be deleted or voided anywhere in the product (edit only).

**Frontend:** `Visit`. `treatment` -> `treatment_notes`; `studentId` -> `student_id`; `excuseLetterDraft` -> a row in `excuse_letters`; `itemsGiven` -> `treatment_item_lines`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `student_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `visited_at` | `datetime` | no |  | Philippine time. Editable (back-dated entry is real), but the service rejects a future time. `created_at` still records when it was typed. |
| `complaint` | `varchar(150)` | no |  | Free text, stored in a known suggestion's spelling. Case-insensitive collation also keeps GROUP BY from splitting "Headache" / "headache". |
| `complaint_type_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Set when the text matches a predefined type (drives the triage checklist). Nullable. |
| `treatment_notes` | `text` | yes | NULL | Optional. Care that isn't stock. |

## excuse_letters

**Module:** ClinicVisits  |  **Tier:** Core

One excuse letter per visit: a draft while Staff prepare it, then permanent once approved. Replaces the split between `Visit.excuseLetterDraft` and `ExcuseLetterApproval`.

**Frontend:** `ExcuseLetterDraft` + `ExcuseLetterApproval`. The API still presents them separately.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `visit_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |

| `reference_no` | `varchar(20)` | yes | NULL | Human-facing number for the printed letter (e.g. EL-2026-0001), assigned at approval from `number_sequences`. |
| `approved_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL |  |
| `approved_at` | `datetime` | yes | NULL |  |
| `snapshot_text` | `mediumtext` | yes | NULL | The rendered letter at approval (student name, grade, period, note, approver). Reprints use this, so a later rename or grade change cannot alter a permanent document. |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_letters_status` (`status`); UNIQUE `uq_letters_reference` (`reference_no`); UNIQUE `uq_letters_visit` (`visit_id`)

## incident_report_approvals

**Module:** EmergencyResponse  |  **Tier:** Core

The nurse's sign-off on an incident report. Stored as a real record because the audit trail has a shorter retention and must not be the only proof of an approval.

## inventory_transactions

**Module:** InventoryTracker  |  **Tier:** Core

Insert-only ledger of every stock movement. History is never rewritten: a correction is a new `adjustment` row.

**Frontend:** `InventoryTransaction`. Mock stores positive quantities for dispense/restock; here `quantity_delta` is always signed.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `is_confirmed` | `tinyint(1)` | no | 1 | 0 = estimated date (mostly Islamic holidays awaiting proclamation). When the confirmed date arrives, the sync must delete the unconfirmed row for that name and year, not just upsert, because the unique key includes the date. |
| `proclamation_ref` | `varchar(120)` | yes | NULL |  |
| `source` | `varchar(60)` | no |  |  |
| `synced_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |

**Indexes:** UNIQUE `uq_holidays_date_name` (`holiday_date`, `name`)

**Checks:**

- `chk_holidays_kind`: `kind in ('regular','special-non-working','special-working','islamic')`

## holiday_sync_runs

**Module:** Dashboard  |  **Tier:** Core

History of holiday sync attempts. "Holidays updated <date>" and the stale warning (about 45 days) read the latest successful run.

| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `ran_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `source` | `varchar(60)` | no |  |  |
| `years_requested` | `varchar(20)` | no |  |  |
| `status` | `varchar(6)` | no |  | On failure the previous holidays stay untouched (last good data is kept). |
| `records_upserted` | `int unsigned` | no | 0 |  |
| `error_message` | `varchar(500)` | yes | NULL |  |

**Indexes:** `idx_holiday_sync_ran` (`ran_at`)

**Checks:**

- `chk_holiday_sync_status`: `status in ('ok','failed')`

## calendar_events

**Module:** Dashboard  |  **Tier:** Core

School events that Staff maintain on the Dashboard calendar (ADR-019).

**Frontend:** `CalendarEvent`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `title` | `varchar(60)` | no |  | 1-60 characters. |
| `start_date` | `date` | no |  |  |
| `end_date` | `date` | yes | NULL | Null for a one-day event. An end date equal to the start is stored as null (CHECK end > start). |
| `created_by_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | no | current_timestamp() |  |
| `last_date` | `date` generated | yes | = coalesce(`end_date`,`start_date`) | Generated: end_date or start_date. Makes "events overlapping this range" a plain index range scan. |

**Indexes:** `idx_events_range` (`start_date`, `last_date`)

**Foreign keys:** `created_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_events_end`: `end_date is null or end_date > start_date`
- `chk_events_title`: `char_length(trim(title)) >= 1`

## issue_reports

**Module:** Shared (Feedback)  |  **Tier:** Core

"Report an issue" feedback from any signed-in role.

**Frontend:** `IssueReport`.

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**Indexes:** `idx_issue_reports_created` (`created_at`)

**Foreign keys:** `reported_by_user_id` -> `users`(`id`) ON DELETE RESTRICT

**Checks:**

- `chk_issue_reports_role`: `reporter_role in ('staff','admin','instructor')`

## audit_logs

**Module:** Shared (AuditLog)  |  **Tier:** Core

Append-only record of who did what and when (RA 10173 accountability). Written for every login, logout, scan, submit, approve, create, update, delete and archive; reading the log is not logged (ADR-016).

**Frontend:** `AuditLogEntry` (+ `summary`, ADR-017).

| Column | Type | Null | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` **PK** | `bigint unsigned` | no |  |  |
| `occurred_at` | `datetime` | no |  |  |
| `actor_user_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Null for system actions (backup ingest, holiday sync, retention purge). |
| `actor_role` | `varchar(12)` | yes | NULL | Snapshot of the actor's role when the action happened. Proposed amendment to ADR-017, which derives it at read time and would show the wrong role after a role change (D-01). |
| `action_type` | `varchar(8)` | no |  |  |
| `target_type` | `varchar(40)` | yes | NULL | Controlled vocabulary kept in code (e.g. `student`, `visit`, `incident`, `excuse_letter`, `inventory_item`, `inventory_transaction`, `calendar_event`, `backup_log`). Not a CHECK, so adding a target needs no ALTER on the biggest table. |
| `target_id` | `bigint unsigned` | yes | NULL | Id of the target row. NO foreign key on purpose: the log must outlive purged records. |
| `subject_student_number` | `char(10)` | yes | NULL | Snapshot of the Student Number the action concerned (resolves the viewer's "Student 2023-00002" label without a join, and survives a purge). |
| `summary` | `varchar(255)` | yes | NULL | Field names or states only, never values (ADR-017). Max 255. |
| `client_ip` | `varbinary(16)` | yes | NULL | Optional. IPv4/IPv6 as 4 or 16 bytes; useful to tell the workstation from a phone. |

**Indexes:** `idx_audit_action_time` (`action_type`, `occurred_at`); `idx_audit_actor_time` (`actor_user_id`, `occurred_at`); `idx_audit_subject` (`subject_student_number`, `occurred_at`); `idx_audit_target` (`target_type`, `target_id`); `idx_audit_target_time` (`target_type`, `occurred_at`); `idx_audit_time` (`occurred_at`)
