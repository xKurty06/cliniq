# CLINIQ Backend Readiness Checklist

Verified Friday, October 09, 2026 — 00:11 PHT. Based on `main` at commit `4c3c8c9`. No repo files were changed before this checklist was integrated.

## Summary

The backend is a blank slate. A [proposed ERD and data dictionary](../02-Architecture/Database/ERD.md) now exist, but they are not final or approved and must not be used for migrations. The frontend has already written much of the spec: the mock API, the entity types, the access matrix, and the ADRs.

**Suggested order of work**

1. ERD and data dictionary
2. API contract
3. Sanctum, foreign-key, and audit-log decisions
4. Phone HTTPS test
5. Client items

---

## 1. Where things stand today

| Area | Current state |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | Only a README and `.env.example`. Laravel is not scaffolded, and `Environment-Setup.md` still says "not yet executed". |
| `ERD.md` | Proposed draft with a data dictionary and reference schema; it is not final or approved. Development-Phases B1 still prohibits migrations until team approval. |
| Mock API (`api.ts`) | 64 functions, about 1,500 lines. It holds real business rules: stock integrity, excused-period checks, duplicate-student detection, next Student Number, incident stage rules. It is a working but unwritten API contract. |
| Auth and roles | The access matrix covers the 11 numbered modules × 3 roles in `Module-Overview.md`, although its introduction and the NFR still say 10 modules. ADR-015 sets a 7-day session lifetime and lockout after 5 failed attempts for 30 minutes. |

## 2. Blockers: do these before any migration

- [ ] **ERD and data dictionary review/approval.** A proposed draft now exists; do not tick this item or build migrations until the team reviews and approves it. Before approval, settle every provisional field in one pass:
  - excuse-letter draft and approval fields (excused period, teacher note)
  - `Visit.referredTo`
  - `itemsGiven` lines (own table with the name and unit snapshot, not a JSON blob)
  - inventory adjustment type, its reason, and its note
  - calendar events
  - issue reports
  - PE referrals
  - record reviews
  - vitals (an open key/value shape, so decide which fields exist)
- [ ] **Frontend-only data needs a real home.** `devAccounts` becomes the users table, which also needs `password_hash`, `must_change_password`, `failed_attempts`, and `locked_until`. None of these are in the `User` type today. The complaint types with Smart Triage steps are clinical content, so they need a table and a nurse's sign-off.
- [ ] **Foreign-key decision.** The mock seed links records by Student Number, while the entity types use an internal id. Recommendation: a surrogate id for foreign keys, plus a unique, immutable Student Number (the QR code encodes it). This is a recommendation, not an approved decision; do not create or amend an ADR for it.
- [ ] **Student Number generator.** The `YYYY-NNNNN` sequence resets yearly (ADR-005). Recommendation: design it as a transactional counter table so two simultaneous saves can't collide; this is not an approved decision.
- [ ] **API contract.** Turn the 64 mock functions into endpoint specs: URL, method, allowed role, request and response shape, error cases. Use one error format (for example 422 with field errors, plus a separate shape for business rejections such as "Medicines on a completed incident can't be changed"). This is the cheapest document to produce, because the code is already the draft.
- [ ] **Sanctum mode.** Development-Phases B2 says to confirm which mechanism applies. ADR-015 requires a 7-day lifetime but explicitly leaves API-token versus SPA-cookie configuration to B2; `.env.example` currently contains SPA-cookie settings. Choose with project approval before implementation; this checklist does not create or amend an ADR.
- [ ] **Audit-log design.** Define the table, which events are logged, how `summary` is produced (field names only, never values, per ADR-017), and a retention number. `Data-Retention-Policy.md` only says "shorter, separate", with no figure. Decide whether the log can be edited or deleted; recommendation: append-only, not an approved decision.

---

## 3. Open decisions that affect the schema

- [ ] **Incident Stage 2:** can medicines be edited after completion? Currently rejected, with a `ponytail:` marker in `completeIncidentStageTwo`.
- [ ] **Sign-off:** should a Stage 1 incident be signable? It currently can be.
- [ ] **Printed documents:** the Excuse Letter and Incident Report need a human-facing reference number, since internal ids must never be shown.
- [ ] **Stored letters:** should an approved Excuse Letter keep its final wording? Right now only the approval is stored.
- [ ] **Reports:** recommendation is to store only the request (type, range, who) and generate the data on demand, as the mock does. This is not currently listed as an open item in `Issues-and-TODOs.md`.
- [ ] **School year and grade promotion:** masterlist import plan, still waiting on the client.

---

## 4. Environment and deployment (not documented anywhere)

- [ ] **HTTPS on the LAN.** Phones scanning QR codes need camera access, and browsers only allow that on a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). The knowledge base never mentions it. Over plain `http://192.168.x.x` the camera will likely be blocked, so plan a local certificate that phones trust. Test early with a real phone, since this can affect the whole QR module.
- [ ] **PHP version.** Check the XAMPP PHP version before picking Laravel (Laravel 11 needs PHP 8.2 or newer).
- [ ] **Pinned versions** for XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, and Laravel, so every dev machine matches.
- [ ] **Backup plan.** The `mysqldump` plus Task Scheduler design is not agreed with the client yet. Also decide how a backup run reports back to Laravel (a log row or a status file), since the Backup screen reads it.
- [ ] **Holiday source.** Still unvalidated (ADR-020). Lowest priority.

---

## 5. Seed and real data to collect

- [ ] Grade levels
- [ ] Real complaint types (with the nurse's sign-off)
- [ ] Medicine and supply list, with starting stock and expiry dates
- [ ] Initial accounts (Staff, Admin, Instructors)
- [ ] Registrar masterlist file format, with column names and a sample, so the import is built to match
- [ ] Migration plan for the mock seed: keep it as the dev seeder, and keep separate real seed data for production

---

## 6. Integration process

- **Switch one module at a time.** The 21 feature `api/` TypeScript files are the swap point. Add one HTTP client and a `VITE_USE_MOCK` flag so each module moves to the real backend independently, as ADR-006 intends.
- **Tests.** Write Pest feature tests that port the mock's rules (the existing Vitest tests in `mock-db` are good cases to copy), plus one per role for the permission matrix, including that instructors are read-only on the server.
- **Definition of done** for each backend phase: migration, endpoint, permission test, audit entry, and the frontend module switched over.

---

## 7. Where I'd push back

1. **The plan has slipped.** The phase table says auth (B2) and audit (B3) should land before F2 gets far, but F2 is nearly complete on mocks. The mock auth hides how much the screens assume real login state, so do B2 and B3 first, before any module API.
2. **Logic lives in two places for now.** `api.ts` has real business rules. The backend must copy them exactly, or the two will drift. Treat `api.ts` as the executable spec and port it function by function.
3. **Doc drift.** The backend README names 9 feature modules (with AuditLog shared), the NFR says 10, and `Module-Overview` says 10 in its introduction while listing 11 numbered modules (including Audit Log Viewer). Fix this before creating the folder structure.
4. **Don't approve the ERD by inspection alone.** Review the proposed Mermaid diagrams in `ERD.md` against the 64 mock functions to catch missing columns.

## Next step

Team review of the proposed ERD and a full endpoint table from the repo are the next documentation steps before migrations.
