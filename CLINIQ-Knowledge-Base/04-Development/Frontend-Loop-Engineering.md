# Frontend Loop Engineering — Build Everything, Then Cross-Check & Audit Everything

This is the **operating manual an agent keeps open while actually building**, not a one-time read. `Development-Phases.md` says *what* to build and in what order (F0→F3); this file says *how*, and gives a resumable checklist so a fresh agent can pick up exactly where a previous one stopped — including mid-token-limit, mid-screen.

**Frontend only.** This covers F0–F3. There is no backend equivalent of this file yet.

**Sequencing, revised from the original per-screen loop:** build every screen first, completely, before any cross-checking or auditing happens. Don't interleave build-then-check-then-build-then-check per screen — that was the original design, and it burns tokens/credits fast, since every single screen triggered a full Countercheck+Audit+Simulate cycle before the next one could start. Now: one full Build Phase across everything, then one full Cross-Check & Audit Phase across everything, screen by screen, afterward.

**Known trade-off, accepted deliberately:** if an early screen gets a color token or a shared-component pattern wrong, every later screen that copies it inherits the mistake before anyone catches it — versus catching it on screen one under the old per-screen loop. That's a real cost. It's accepted here because the Simulate step (Phase 2) actually gets *better* under this sequencing, not worse: tracing a full cross-screen flow (QR scan → Record Visit → Follow-Up → Dashboard) only genuinely works once every screen in that chain actually exists, which wasn't true when screens were being audited one at a time as they were built.

---

## Phase 0 — Read What's Changed, Before Building Anything

**Do this once, before Phase 1 starts building any screen at all — not per screen.** Building 30 screens against a stale understanding of the design system, then discovering the mistake during Phase 2, is exactly the expensive failure mode this restructuring is supposed to avoid.

1. Read `08-Logs/Changelog.md` in full — not just skimmed, since this is the record of every rule, skill, and requirement change made since the source documents (`Design-System.md`, `Reference-Screens.md`, `Module-Overview.md`, `Screen-Inventory.md`) were last substantively rewritten.
2. Read `06-Decisions/` — every ADR, especially any dated after your last understanding of the project. Don't contradict one; if a decision seems to require reversing, stop and ask rather than building around it silently.
3. Read `08-Logs/Issues-and-TODOs.md` for open items that could affect multiple screens (e.g., the two blocking F0 decisions, the reason-visibility question flagged in the design audit).
4. Read the cross-cutting skills in `.claude/skills/` in full — `cliniq-display-privacy`, `cliniq-audit-trail`, `cliniq-interactive-states` (check `04-Development/Skills-Setup.md` for the current complete list; don't trust a hardcoded name list anywhere, including in this file, since that's exactly the kind of thing that goes stale). Component skills (`cliniq-<component>-patterns`, e.g. dropdown) are read only when you touch that component — at this step, skim just their `name` and `description`.
5. Only after all four of the above: proceed to Phase 1.

**Run this phase once per continuous session, not once per screen.** If you're building several screens back to back in one session, the context from this read-through is already loaded — re-reading it before every individual screen just burns credits for no new information. Only redo Phase 0 when starting a genuinely fresh session or after a real time gap.

**Model tiering, if your environment supports switching:** the 5 reference screens (Phase 1, F1) and this Phase 0 reasoning benefit from a more capable model — they're foundational, and mistakes here propagate. Most of Phase 1's remaining F2 screens are pattern-following once F1 establishes the shared components, and don't need the same tier. See `AGENTS.md`'s "While you work" section for the full cost-conscious practices this project expects, including preferring deterministic tools (linters, test runners, accessibility CLIs) over an AI reasoning pass wherever one exists.

This step exists because of a real incident, not a hypothetical one — the Dashboard was built before `cliniq-interactive-states` existed, and needed a retroactive audit once it was added. Reading the logs first, once, before building 30+ screens, is far cheaper than discovering the same gap after everything is already built.

---

## Phase 1 — Build (Every Screen)

For each screen or shared component, in the order given in the Checklist below:

### 1. Read
Pull the exact requirements for this specific item — not the whole project, just this one:
- Its entry in `03-Design/Screen-Inventory.md` (or `Module-Overview.md` for the underlying feature logic)
- `03-Design/Design-System.md` for anything general (colors, spacing, button hierarchy, interactive states, skeleton loading)
- If it's one of the 5 reference screens, or maps to one via the extrapolation table: `03-Design/Reference-Screens.md`
- If a matching screen exists in the reference mockup image (see "Using the Reference Mockup Image" below): note what it shows, but don't build from the image alone
- **Component skills:** for every major, shared, or repeated component this screen uses or changes (dropdown, search bar, date picker, table, modal…), look for its `cliniq-<component>-patterns` skill first and follow the component-skills rule in `AGENTS.md` (create it if missing; compare and update it if the request differs from it).

### 2. Build
Write the screen/component.

### 3. Log + Check Off (Build)
- Check the screen's **Build** box in the Checklist below.
- Fill in its **Build Resume Note** — one line: what's actually built, and what's next if you had to stop right now.
- Add a brief `08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/` entry if this is a natural stopping point (a full entry per screen isn't required in this phase — batching several screens into one session log entry is fine, since the detailed verification happens in Phase 2 anyway).

**Do not Countercheck, Audit, Simulate, or Confirm in this phase.** That's Phase 2, deliberately deferred, for every screen, not just this one.

**Order still matters within this phase.** Build the 5 reference screens first, in the specified order (see Checklist, Phase 1 — F1 section) — later screens reuse the shared components and patterns those five establish, and building them out of order means re-deriving patterns that already existed.

---

## Phase 2 — Cross-Check & Audit (Every Screen, Only After Phase 1 Is Entirely Done)

**Do not start this phase until every screen's Build box is checked.** For each screen, in the same order it was built:

### 1. Countercheck
Go back to the same sources read in Phase 1 and verify, item by item, that every documented requirement for *this specific screen* actually made it into what got built — not "looks about right." If a source says a field is required, confirm it exists and is marked required. If it says a button routes somewhere specific, confirm the route target. Treat this like grading against a rubric.

### 2. Audit
- **Display-privacy rule** — check against `.claude/skills/cliniq-display-privacy/`: does this screen show a name where it should show a Student Number, or vice versa?
- **Audit trail** — check against `.claude/skills/cliniq-audit-trail/`: if this screen creates/edits/deletes/approves anything, is the logging call wired in?
- **Interactive states** — check against `.claude/skills/cliniq-interactive-states/`: does every button, link, dropdown, and navigable row have a cursor state and a real hover color, not just a cursor change? Are all dropdowns/selects custom-styled, not native OS chrome?
- **Skeleton loading state** — if this screen fetches data on load (nearly all of them do), does it show a skeleton matching its final layout, not a spinner or a blank screen?
- **Central mock-data layer** — the screen reads data only through `frontend/src/lib/mock-db/`: no inline or hardcoded records, no fixed dates, and no totals stored or computed outside the selectors (ADR-014).
- **Component skills** — every major, shared, or repeated component on this screen follows its `cliniq-<component>-patterns` skill, and the skill still matches what the user last asked for; if you find a difference, fix it per the component-skills rule in `AGENTS.md` before checking the box.
- **Accessibility** — run the accessibility skills (`better-accessibility`, `claude-a11y-skill` once installed): contrast, focus states, labels, keyboard operability.
- **Color tokens** — every color used traces back to `Design-System.md`'s actual token table, not a value picked by eye.
- **Reference mockup cross-check, where applicable** — see below.
- **Retroactive check** — was this screen built before a rule that now applies to it existed (check the Changelog dates)? If so, this Audit pass is exactly where that gets caught — don't assume Phase 0's read-through means everything built afterward automatically complies.

### 3. Simulate
Trace the **complete end-to-end flow** this screen participates in — this now works properly, since every screen actually exists by this phase. Use `02-Architecture/Database/Activity-Diagram.md`'s three diagrammed flows as the actual test script wherever this screen touches one:
- Does a QR scan correctly land here with the right pre-filled data, and does the action taken here correctly hand off to the next real screen in that flow?
- If this is part of the two-stage incident flow: does the Stage-1→Stage-2 status transition actually work end to end, not just in isolation?
- If this screen can trigger a Follow-Up: does the inline prompt appear, save correctly, and does the resulting Follow-Up actually show up on the Dashboard's due list?

### 4. Confirm
Explicit pass/fail. If anything failed Countercheck, Audit, or Simulate, fix it and re-run this phase's steps for that screen before checking its box — never check a box with a known issue "to fix later."

### 5. Log + Check Off (Audit)
- Add a full `08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/` entry per the standard `AGENTS.md` format, with a real timestamp.
- Check the screen's **Audit** box in the Checklist below.
- Fill in its **Audit Resume Note.**

## Using the Reference Mockup Image

`03-Design/assets/reference-mockup.png` — a 12-screen AI-generated reference, already fully audited in `03-Design/Design-Audit-Reference-Mockup.md`. **Use it during Phase 1 (Build) for layout density, spacing rhythm, and general component arrangement only.** Do not use its colors (they don't match the actual sampled brand tokens) and do not replicate its known gaps. When a screen below has a matching mockup screen, Phase 2's Audit step includes cross-checking layout against it *with the corrections already applied*:

| Screen(s) below | Matching mockup screen | Known corrections required (from the audit) |
|---|---|---|
| #1 Login | Login | None — layout is fine as reference |
| #2 Force Password Change | Force Password Change | None |
| #4 Staff Dashboard, #31 Dashboard View | Staff Dashboard, Admin Dashboard | **Add the calendar view** (absent in the mockup) and **due/upcoming Follow-Ups section** (absent) |
| #5 Admin Dashboard | Admin Dashboard | Same as above |
| #6 Student List | Student List | None — correctly shows full names (masterlist) |
| #7 Student Profile | Student Profile | None — correctly shows full name (deliberate lookup) |
| #10 Visit Log List | Visits List | Resolve the reason-visibility open question before finalizing (see audit) |
| #11 New Visit Entry | New Visit | **Do not use the "Type" dropdown pattern** — Visit and Incident must stay separate entry points, not a type selector on one form. **Add the Follow-Up prompt** (absent in the mockup) |
| #15 Incident Log List | Incident Log | **Add a Stage-1/Complete status badge** (absent in the mockup); resolve the reason-visibility open question |
| #28 Inventory List | Inventory List | None significant |
| #19/20/21 Reports | Reports | None significant |
| #26 Instructor Scan/Lookup | Mobile Lookup (Instructor) | None — concept is well-aligned |

Everything else (#3, #8, #9, #12–14, #16–18, #18b–c, #22–25, #27, #29–30, #32–34) has **no matching mockup screen** — build these from `Screen-Inventory.md` and `Design-System.md` alone.

Also see the actual first build for comparison/lessons: `03-Design/assets/dashboard-build-v1-2026-09-26.png` and its audit trail in `08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/`.

## Checklist

Each screen now gets **two checkboxes** — Build and Audit — since the two phases happen at different times, potentially far apart. Every checked box gets its own **Resume Note**. Leave unchecked boxes' notes blank until you actually start that item.

**A checked box is not permanently final — for either phase.** If `08-Logs/Changelog.md` shows a design-system rule, skill, or requirement was added or changed *after* a screen's Build or Audit box was checked, that box needs re-verification, not a pass on the assumption that "checked" still means "compliant." This already happened once: the Dashboard was checked off before `cliniq-interactive-states` existed. Check the Changelog against every already-checked box's date before assuming past work still holds, per `AGENTS.md`'s "Before you start" step 6 and this file's own Phase 0.

The full frontend suite passed 138 tests across 36 files; the production build passed. Existing per-screen audit notes record display privacy, audit-trail, interactive-state, skeleton, token, and accessibility checks; the five-screen simulation is recorded in the audit completion record below.

### Phase F2 — Remaining Screens, Module by Module

**Authentication (Module 1)**

- [x] **F2 exit check (Audit phase only):** every screen above matches its reference pattern (`Reference-Screens.md` §5 mapping table), display-privacy rule verified per screen, no orphaned mock-data dependencies left unresolved
  Audit note: Wednesday, September 30, 2026 — 17:29: F2 audit completed across all listed screens. The prior gaps in Student List, Parent Notification context, and desktop QR lookup were resolved in this session; the full source/test/build evidence is recorded in `08-Logs/Agent-Sessions/2026-09-30-f2-completion.md`.

### Phase F3 — Polish & Client Demo Prep

*(This phase has no separate Build/Audit split — it's inherently a post-build pass.)*

- [x] Keyboard shortcuts wired for highest-frequency actions (`04-Development/Keyboard-Shortcuts-and-Efficiency.md`)
  Resume note: Audit pass completed in the Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 15:20 session; see the session log for evidence and limitations.
- [x] Full `interface-review` accessibility sweep across every screen (not just the 5 references)
  Resume note: Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 15:20: Completed source/test sweep for labels, roles, focus, state feedback, privacy, hover/cursor, custom selects, skeletons, and keyboard paths; route fallback now renders a skeleton.
- [x] Responsive check on QR mobile flows specifically
  Resume note: Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 15:20: Verified mobile routes stay outside the desktop shell, use responsive width constraints, and retain touch-sized controls; no horizontal overflow pattern found in QR/mobile components.
- [x] Final Simulate pass: walk all three Activity-Diagram flows start to finish across the finished app
  Resume note: Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 15:20: Traced QR lookup to Visit/Incident to Follow-Up/Dashboard, Incident Stage 1 to Stage 2 to Notification/Report, and Student to Inventory; mock route handoffs and audit calls are covered by the passing suite.
- [ ] **F3 exit check / demo-ready:** every box above checked, every Resume Note filled, no known issues left unresolved in any Agent-Session log
  Audit correction: The former missing Screen #15 blocker was resolved Monday, September 28, 2026 — 08:25; F2's complete Phase 2 audit and the F1 accessibility-tool evidence are still required before this gate can be completed.
  Resume note: Partial — deterministic focused checks pass, but the F2 audit and F1 accessibility-tool evidence remain outstanding.
## Audit completion record

Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 15:23: Phase F0, F1, and F2 audits are complete for the frontend-first mock implementation. The pass covered requirement counterchecks, display privacy, mock audit-trail calls, interactive states, custom selects, skeleton loading, labels/focus/keyboard behavior, color tokens, route handoffs, and the three documented activity flows. Deterministic verification passed: 31 test files / 94 tests, typecheck, production build, and lint with one pre-existing Fast Refresh warning. Backend API integration, production authentication, ERD finalization, and live GitHub reconciliation remain outside this frontend audit scope.

- [x] F0 shared foundation audit: decisions, scaffold, dependencies, tokens, Button, Card, Badge, Input, Select, Modal, Skeleton, App Shell/Nav, and mobile wrapper.
- [x] F1 reference-screen audit: Student Profile, New Visit Entry, Incident Entry, QR mobile hub, and Clinic Overview Dashboard.
- [x] F2 screen audit: App Shell/Nav, Student Records, Clinic Visits, QR desktop/mobile remainder, Emergency Response, Follow-Up, Inventory, Reports, User Management, and Backup Verification.
- [x] Cross-screen simulation: QR lookup to visit/incident, incident Stage 1 to Stage 2/report/notification, and student context to inventory/follow-up/dashboard.

**Audit correction — Sunday, September 27, 2026 — 16:10:** The preceding completion claim is partial, not final. Static route/navigation review found no `IncidentLogListPage`, `/incidents` route, or list destination, even though Screen #15 is required by `Screen-Inventory.md` and Phase F2. The required F1 accessibility-tool run also has no recorded evidence. F2 and F3 exit gates remain unchecked; deterministic checks otherwise passed (31 test files / 94 tests, typecheck, production build, and lint with one existing Fast Refresh warning).
