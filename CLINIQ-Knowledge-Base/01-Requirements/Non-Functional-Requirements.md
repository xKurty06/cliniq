# Non-Functional Requirements — Full Detail

Kept in sync with the canonical Project Plan, Section 5.1. If you edit one, edit both.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** must run acceptably on the existing minimum-spec workstation (Intel Core i3 or equivalent, 4GB RAM) with no perceptible lag during data entry. The React frontend is compiled into optimized static assets at build time, so the workstation only ever serves and renders a finished bundle — it does not need to run the heavier Node.js build tooling in production, only during development
- **Security & Privacy:** Laravel Sanctum (bcrypt password hashing, session/token handling), session timeout, account lockout after repeated failed logins, and handling aligned with RA 10173 (legitimate purpose, consent, purpose limitation, and a defined data retention policy — see Section 5.3)
- **Availability:** must function fully offline from the public internet, over the school's employee-tier intranet only
- **Usability:** must be learnable by non-technical clinic staff within a single training session
- **Maintainability:** codebase and database schema documented clearly enough for the school's outsourced IT provider to support after the team's academic involvement ends
- **Modularity & Scalability** (added this session): the system must be built so each of the 10 modules is a loosely-coupled, independently developable and testable unit — not just at the planning level (already true, per Modules & Features), but in the actual code. Frontend already commits to this (`06-Decisions/ADR-008-Frontend-Folder-Structure.md` — one feature folder per module). This NFR extends the same principle to the backend, formalized in `06-Decisions/ADR-009-Modular-Backend-Architecture.md`. Reasoning: with 3 developers and potentially several AI agents working on different modules concurrently, tightly-coupled code multiplies merge conflicts and cross-module breakage; loosely-coupled modules also mean a module can be tested, reviewed, or handed to the outsourced IT provider in isolation, and the system can grow (more modules, more students, eventually a remote/cloud deployment) without a structural rewrite — the same reasoning already applied to the LAN→Cloud deployment path, extended to code organization itself.
